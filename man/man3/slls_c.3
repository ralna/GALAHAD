.SH "Introduction"
.PP
.SS "Purpose"
This package uses a preconditioned, projected-gradient method to solve the \fBsimplex-constrained regularized linear least-squares problem\fP \[\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = 1/2 || A x - b||_2^2 + 1/2 sigma ||x||^2\]  
  \n
  minimize q(x) := 1/2 || A x - b ||^2 + sigma ||x||^2
  \n
 where x is required to lie in the regular simplex \[e^T x = 1 \;\;\mbox{and}\;\; x_j >= 0, \;\;\; j = 1, ... , n,\]  
  \n
   e^T x = 1 and x_j \[>=] 0, j = 1, ... , n,
  \n
 where the m by n real matrix A, the vector b,and the non-negative weight sigma are given, and e is the vector of ones\&. Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients of the Jacobian matrix A of the \fBresiduals\fP c(x) = A x - b; the matrix need not be provided as there are options to obtain matrix-vector products involving A and its transpose either by reverse communication or from a user-provided subroutine\&.

.SS "Originally released"
October 2019, C interface July 2022\&.
.SS "Terminology"
The required solution x necessarily satisfies the primal optimality conditions \[e^T x = 1 \;\;\mbox{and}\;\; x >= 0 ,\]  
  \n
   e^T x = 1 and x [>=] 0,
  \n
 the dual optimality conditions \[(A^T A + sigma I ) x = A^T b + z\]  
  \n
   ( A^T A + sigma I ) x = A^T b + z
  \n
 where the dual variables \[ z >= 0,\]  
  \n
   zl \[>=] 0,
  \n
 and the complementary slackness conditions \[x^T z = 0,\hspace{12mm} \]  
  \n
  x^T z = 0,
  \n
 where the vector inequalities hold component-wise\&.
.SS "Method"
The method is iterative\&. Each iteration proceeds in two stages\&. Firstly, a search direction s from the current estimate of the solution x is computed\&. This may be in a scaled steepest-descent direction, or, if the working set of variables on bounds has not changed dramatically, in a direction that provides an approximate minimizer of the objective over a subspace comprising the currently free-variables\&. The latter is computed either using an appropriate sparse factorization by the GALAHAD package SBLS, or by the conjugate-gradient least-squares (CGLS) method; tt may be necessary to regularize the subproblem very slightly to avoid a ill-posedness\&. Thereafter, a piecewise linesearch (arc search) is carried out along the arc x(alpha) = P( x + alpha s) for alpha > 0, where the projection operator P(v) gives the nearest feasible point to v within the regular simplex; thus this arc bends the search direction into the feasible region\&. The arc search is performed either exactly, by passing through a set of increasing breakpoints at which it changes direction, or inexactly, by evaluating a sequence of different alpha on the arc\&. All computation is designed to exploit sparsity in A\&.

.SS "Call order"
To solve a given problem, functions from the slls package must be called in the following order:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBslls_initialize\fP - provide default control parameters and set up initial data structures
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBslls_read_specfile\fP (optional) - override control values by reading replacement values from a file
.IP "\(bu" 2
set up problem data structures and fixed values by caling one of
.IP "  \(bu" 4
\fBslls_import\fP - in the case that A is explicitly available
.IP "  \(bu" 4
\fBslls_import_without_a\fP - in the case that only the effect of applying A and its transpose to a vector is possible
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBslls_reset_control\fP (optional) - possibly change control parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved
.IP "\(bu" 2
solve the problem by calling one of
.IP "  \(bu" 4
\fBslls_solve_given_a\fP - solve the problem using values of A
.IP "  \(bu" 4
\fBslls_solve_reverse_a_prod\fP - solve the problem by returning to the caller for products of A and its transpose with specified vectors
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBslls_information\fP (optional) - recover information about the solution and solution process
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBslls_terminate\fP - deallocate data structures
.PP
.PP
   
  See the examples section for illustrations of use.
  
.SS "Unsymmetric matrix storage formats"
The unsymmetric m by n matrix A may be presented and stored in a variety of convenient input formats\&.
.PP
Both C-style (0 based) and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed\&. Choose \fCcontrol\&.f_indexing\fP as \fCfalse\fP for C style and \fCtrue\fP for fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to indices for the corresponding fortran version\&.
.PP
Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C\&. This conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing\&.
.SS "Dense row storage format"
The matrix A is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array\&. In this case, component n * i + j of the storage array A_val will hold the value A_{ij} for 0 <= i <= m-1, 0 <= j <= n-1\&.
.SS "Dense column storage format"
The matrix A is stored as a compact dense matrix by columns, that is, the values of the entries of each column in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array\&. In this case, component m * j + i of the storage array A_val will hold the value A_{ij} for 0 <= i <= m-1, 0 <= j <= n-1\&.
.SS "Sparse co-ordinate storage format"
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored\&. For the l-th entry, 0 <= l <= ne-1, of A, its row index i, column index j and value A_{ij}, 0 <= i <= m-1, 0 <= j <= n-1, are stored as the l-th components of the integer arrays A_row and A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as A_ne = ne\&.
.SS "Sparse row-wise storage format"
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those in row i+1\&. For the i-th row of A the i-th component of the integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row, while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries plus one\&. The column indices j, 0 <= j <= n-1, and values A_{ij} of the nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components l = A_ptr(i), \&.\&.\&., A_ptr(i+1)-1, 0 <= i <= m-1, of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively\&. For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than its predecessors\&.
.SS "Sparse column-wise storage format"
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in column j appear directly before those in column j+1\&. For the j-th column of A the j-th component of the integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this column, while A_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one\&. The row indices i, 0 <= i <= m-1, and values A_{ij} of the nonzero entries in the j-th column are stored in components l = A_ptr(j), \&.\&.\&., A_ptr(j+1)-1, 0 <= j <= n-1, of the integer array A_row, and real array A_val, respectively\&. Once again, for sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than the dense of coordinate formats\&.
