.SS "Purpose"
This package uses the \fB simplex method\fP to solve the \fBlinear programming problem\fP \[\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = g^T x + f \]  
  \n
  minimize q(x) := g^T x + f
  \n
 subject to the general linear constraints \[c_i^l <= a_i^Tx <= c_i^u, \;\;\; i = 1, ... , m,\]  
  \n
   c_i^l \[<=] a_i^Tx \[<=] c_i^u, i = 1, ... , m,
  \n
 and the simple bound constraints \[x_j^l <= x_j <= x_j^u, \;\;\; j = 1, ... , n,\]  
  \n
   x_j^l \[<=] x_j \[<=] x_j^u, j = 1, ... , n,
  \n
 where the vectors g, w, x^{0}, a_i, c^l, c^u, x^l, x^u and the scalar f are given\&. Any of the constraint bounds c_i^l, c_i^u, x_j^l and x_j^u may be infinite\&. Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix A whose rows are the transposes of the vectors a_i\&.
.PP
\fBN\&.B\&.\fP The package is simply a sophisticated interface to the HSL package LA04, and requires that a user has obtained the latter\&. \fB LA04 is not included in GALAHAD\fP but is available without charge to recognised academics, see http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/catalogue/la04.html\&. If LA04 is unavailable, the GALAHAD interior-point linear programming package LPB is an alternative\&.

.SS "Terminology"
The required solution x necessarily satisfies the primal optimality conditions \[\mbox{(1a) $\hspace{66mm} A x = c\hspace{66mm}$}\]  
  \n
  (1a) A x = c
  \n
 and \[\mbox{(1b) $\hspace{52mm} c^l <= c <= c^u, \;\; x^l <= x <= x^u,\hspace{52mm}$} \]  
  \n
  (1b) c^l \[<=] c \[<=] c^u, x^l \[<=] x \[<=] x^u,
  \n
 the dual optimality conditions \[\mbox{(2a) $\hspace{3mm} g = A^T y + z$}\]  
  \n
  (2a) g = A^T y + z
  \n
 where \[\mbox{(2b) $\hspace{24mm} y = y^l + y^u, \;\; z = z^l + z^u, \,\, y^l >= 0 , \;\; y^u <= 0 , \;\; z^l >= 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\; z^u <= 0,\hspace{24mm}$} \]  
  \n
   (2b) y = y^l + y^u, z = z^l + z^u, y^l \[>=] 0, y^u \[<=] 0,
        z^l \[>=] 0 and z^u \[<=] 0,
  \n
 and the complementary slackness conditions \[\mbox{(3) $\hspace{12mm} ( A x - c^l )^T y^l = 0 ,\;\; ( A x - c^u )^T y^u = 0 ,\;\; (x -x^l )^T z^l = 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\; (x -x^u )^T z^u = 0,\hspace{12mm} $}\]  
  \n
  (3) (A x - c^l)^T y^l = 0, (A x - c^u)^T y^u = 0,
      (x -x^l)^T z^l = 0 and (x -x^u)^T z^u = 0,
  \n
 where the vectors y and z are known as the Lagrange multipliers for the general linear constraints, and the dual variables for the bounds, respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold component-wise\&.
.PP
The so-called dual to this problem is another linear program \[- \mbox{minimize} \;\; c^{lT} y^l + c^{uT} y^u + x^{lT} z^l + x^{uT} z^u + f \;\; \mbox{subject to the constraints (2a) and (2b)}\]  
  \n
  - minimize c^{lT} y^l + c^{uT} y^u + x^{lT} z^l + x^{uT} z^u + f
  subject to the constraints (2a) and (2b)
  \n
 that uses the same data\&. The solution to the two problems, it is exists, is the same, but if one is infeasible, the other is unbounded\&. It can be more efficient to solve the dual, particularly if m is much larger than n\&.
.SS "Method"
The bulk of the work is peformed by the HSL package LA04\&. The main subbroutine from this package requires that the input problem be transformed into the ``standard form''    
  \n
         minimize g'^T x'
  (4)  subject to A' x' = b
                  l_i <= x'_i <= u_i, for i <= k
              and x'_l >= 0, for i >= l
  \n
 by introducing slack an surpulus variables, reordering and removing fixed variables and free constraints\&. The resulting problem involves n' unknowns and m' general constraints\&. In order to deal with the possibility that the general constraints are inconsistent or not of full rank, LA04 introduces additional ``artifical'' variables v and replaces the constraints of (4) by \[(5) \;\; A' x' + v = b\] and gradually encourages v to zero as a first solution phase\&.
.PP
Once a selection of m' independent \fBnon-basic\fP variables is made, the constraints (5) determine the remaining m' dependent \fBbasic\fP variables\&. The \fBsimplex method\fP is a scheme for systematically adjusting the choice of basic and non-basic variables until a set which defines an optimal solution of (4) is obtained\&. Each iteration of the simplex method requires the solution of a number of sets of linear equations whose coefficient matrix is the \fBbasis\fP matrix B, made up of the columns of [A' I] corresponding to the basic variables, or its transpose B^T\&. As the basis matrices for consecutive iterations are closely related, it is normally advantageous to update (rather than recompute) their factorizations as the computation proceeds\&. If an initial basis is not provided by the user, a set of basic variables which provide a (permuted) triangular basis matrix is found by the simple crash algorithm of Gould and Reid (1989), and initial steepest-edge weights are calculated\&.
.PP
Phases one (finding a feasible solution) and two (solving (4) of the simplex method are applied, as appropriate, with the choice of entering variable as described by Goldfarb and Reid (1977) and the choice of leaving variable as proposed by Harris (1973)\&. Refactorizations of the basis matrix are performed whenever doing so will reduce the average iteration time or there is insufficient memory for its factors\&. The reduced cost for the entering variable is computed afresh\&. If it is found to be of a different sign from the recurred value or more than 10% different in magnitude, a fresh computation of all the reduced costs is performed\&. Details of the factorization and updating procedures are given by Reid (1982)\&. Iterative refinement is encouraged for the basic solution and for the reduced costs after each factorization of the basis matrix and when they are recomputed at the end of phase 1\&.

  See the examples section for illustrations of use.
  
.SS "Unsymmetric matrix storage formats"
The unsymmetric m by n constraint matrix A may be presented and stored in a variety of convenient input formats\&.
.PP
Both C-style (0 based) and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed\&. Choose \fCcontrol\&.f_indexing\fP as \fCfalse\fP for C style and \fCtrue\fP for fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to indices for the corresponding fortran version\&.
.PP
Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C\&. This conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing\&.
.SS "Dense storage format"
The matrix A is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array\&. In this case, component n * i + j of the storage array A_val will hold the value A_{ij} for 0 <= i <= m-1, 0 <= j <= n-1\&.
.SS "Sparse co-ordinate storage format"
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored\&. For the l-th entry, 0 <= l <= ne-1, of A, its row index i, column index j and value A_{ij}, 0 <= i <= m-1, 0 <= j <= n-1, are stored as the l-th components of the integer arrays A_row and A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as A_ne = ne\&.
.SS "Sparse row-wise storage format"
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those in row i+1\&. For the i-th row of A the i-th component of the integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row, while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries\&. The column indices j, 0 <= j <= n-1, and values A_{ij} of the nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components l = A_ptr(i), \&.\&.\&., A_ptr(i+1)-1, 0 <= i <= m-1, of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively\&. For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than its predecessor\&.
