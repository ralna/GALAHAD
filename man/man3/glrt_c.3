.SS "Purpose"
Given real n by n symmetric matrices H and M (with M positive definite), real n vector c, and scalars sigma>= 0 and f_0, this package finds an \fB approximate minimizer of the regularised quadratic objective function\fP \[1/2 x^T H x + c^T x + f_0 + \frac{1}{p} sigma ||x||_M^p,\]  
\n
1/2 x^T H x + c^T x + f_0 + 1/p sigma ||x||^p_M,
\n
 where || v ||_M = sqrt{v^T M v} is the M-norm of v\&. This problem commonly occurs as a subproblem in nonlinear optimization calculations involving cubic regularisation\&. The method may be suitable for large n as no factorization of H is required\&. Reverse communication is used to obtain matrix-vector products of the form H z and M^{-1} z\&.

.SS "Terminology"
.SS "Method"
The required solution x necessarily satisfies the optimality condition H x + lambda M x + c + lambda o = 0, where lambda = sigma [ ||x||_M^2]^{p/2-1}\&. In addition, the matrix H + lambda M will be positive semi-definite\&.
.PP
The method is iterative\&. Starting with the vector M^{-1} c, a matrix of Lanczos vectors is built one column at a time so that the k-th column is generated during iteration k\&. These columns span a so-called Krylov space\&. The resulting n by k matrix Q_k has the property that Q_k^T H Q_k = T_k , where T_k is tridiagonal\&. An approximation to the required solution may then be expressed formally as \[x_{k+1} = Q_k y_k,\]  
\n
   x_{k+1}  =  Q_k y_k
\n
 where y_k solves the ``tridiagonal'' subproblem of minimizing \[(1) \;\;\; 1/2 y^T T_k y + || c||_{M^{-1}} e_1^T y + \frac{1}{p} sigma || y ||^p_2,\]  
\n
  (1) 1/2  y^T T_k y  + || c||_{M^{-1}} e_1^T y + 1/p sigma || y ||^p_2,
\n
 where e_1 is the first unit vector\&.
.PP
To minimize (1), the optimality conditions \[(2) \;\;\; ( T_k + lambda I ) y(lambda) = - c - lambda d,\]  
\n
  (2)   ( T_k + lambda I ) y(lambda) = - c - lambda d,
\n
 where lambda = sigma ||y(lambda)+d||^{p-2}_M are used as the basis of an iteration\&. Specifically, given an estimate lambda for which T_k + lambda I is positive definite, the tridiagonal system (2) may be efficiently solved to give y(lambda)\&. It is then simply a matter of adjusting lambda (for example by a Newton-like process) to solve the scalar nonlinear equation \[(3) \;\;\; \theta(lambda) = ||y(lambda)+d||^{p-2}_M - \frac{lambda}{sigma} = 0.\]  
\n
  (3) theta(lambda) =  ||y(lambda)+d||^{p-2}_M - lambda/sigma = 0.
\n
 In practice (3) is reformulated, and a more rapidly converging iteration is used\&.
.PP
It is possible to measure the optimality measure ||H x + lambda M x + c + lambda o||_{M^{-1}} without computing x_{k+1}, and thus without needing Q_k \&. Once this measure is sufficiently small, a second pass is required to obtain the estimate x_{k+1} from y_k \&. As this second pass is an additional expense, a record is kept of the optimal objective function values for each value of k, and the second pass is only performed so far as to ensure a given fraction of the final optimal objective value\&. Large savings may be made in the second pass by choosing the required fraction to be significantly smaller than one\&.
.PP
Special code is used in the special case p=2, as in this case a single pass suffices\&.
