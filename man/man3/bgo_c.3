.SH "Introduction"
.PP
.SS "Purpose"
The bgo package uses a \fBmulti-start trust-region method to find an approximation to the global minimizer of a differentiable objective function f(x) of n variables x, subject to simple bounds x^l <= x <= x^u on the variables\&.\fP Here, any of the components of the vectors of bounds x^l and x^u may be infinite\&. The method offers the choice of direct and iterative solution of the key trust-region subproblems, and is suitable for large problems\&. First derivatives are required, and if second derivatives can be calculated, they will be exploited---if the product of second derivatives with a vector may be found but not the derivatives themselves, that may also be exploited\&.
.PP
The package offers both random multi-start and local-minimize-and probe methods to try to locate the global minimizer\&. There are no theoretical guarantees unless the sampling is huge, and realistically the success of the methods decreases as the dimension and nonconvexity increase\&.

.SS "Terminology"
The \fIgradient\fP nabla_x f(x) of f(x) is the vector whose i-th component is partial f(x)/partial x_i\&. The \fIHessian\fP nabla_{xx} f(x) of f(x) is the symmetric matrix whose i,j-th entry is partial^2 f(x)/partial x_i partial x_j\&. The Hessian is \fIsparse\fP if a significant and useful proportion of the entries are universally zero\&.
.SS "Method"
A choice of two methods is available\&. In the first, local-minimization-and-probe, approach, local minimization and univariate global minimization are intermixed\&. Given a current champion x^S_k, a local minimizer x_k of f(x) within the feasible box x^l <= x <= x^u is found using the GALAHAD package trb\&. Thereafter m random directions p are generated, and univariate local minimizer of f(x_k + alpha p) as a function of the scalar alpha along each p within the interval [alpha^L,alpha^u], where alpha^L and alpha^u are the smallest and largest alpha for which x^l <= x_k + alpha p <= x^u, is performed using the GALAHAD package ugo\&. The point x_k + alpha p that gives the smallest value of f is then selected as the new champion x^S_{k+1}\&.
.PP
The random directions p are chosen in one of three ways\&. The simplest is to select the components as  
(ignore next phrase - doxygen bug!)
 \[p_i = \mbox{pseudo random} \in \left\{ \begin{array}{rl} \mbox{[-1,1]} & \mbox{if} \;\; x^l_i < x_{k,i} < x^u_i \\ \mbox{[0,1]} & \mbox{if} \;\; x_{k,i} = x^l_i \\ \mbox{[-1,0]} & \mbox{if} \;\; x_{k,i} = x^u_i \end{array} \right. \]  
  \n
                         ( [-1,1] if x^l_i < x_{k,i} < x^u_i
  p_i = pseudo random in ( [0,1] if x_{k,i} = x^l_i
                         ( [-1,0] if x_{k,i} = x^u_i
  \n
 for each 1 <= i <= n\&. An alternative is to pick p by partitioning each dimension of the feasible ``hypercube'' box into m equal segments, and then selecting sub-boxes randomly within this hypercube using GALAHAD's Latin hypercube sampling package, lhs\&. Each components of p is then selected in its sub-box, either uniformly or pseudo randomly\&.
.PP
The other, random-multi-start, method provided selects m starting points at random, either componentwise pseudo randomly in the feasible box, or by partitioning each component into m equal segments, assigning each to a sub-box using Latin hypercube sampling, and finally choosing the values either uniformly or pseudo randomly\&. Local minimizers within the feasible box are then computed by the GALAHAD package trb, and the best is assigned as the current champion\&. This process is then repeated until evaluation limits are achieved\&.
.PP
If n=1, the GALAHAD package UGO is called directly\&.
.PP
We reiterate that there are no theoretical guarantees unless the sampling is huge, and realistically the success of the methods decreases as the dimension and nonconvexity increase\&. Thus the methods used should best be viewed as heuristics\&.

.SH "Call order"
.PP
To solve a given problem, functions from the bgo package must be called in the following order:
.PP

.SH "Symmetric matrix storage formats"
.PP
The symmetric n by n matrix H = nabla_{xx}f may be presented and stored in a variety of formats\&. But crucially symmetry is exploited by only storing values from the lower triangular part (i\&.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal)\&.
.PP
Both C-style (0 based) and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed\&. Choose \fCcontrol\&.f_indexing\fP as \fCfalse\fP for C style and \fCtrue\fP for fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to indices for the corresponding fortran version\&.
.PP
Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C\&. This conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing\&.
.SS "Dense storage format"
The matrix H is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array\&. Since H is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part H_{ij} for 0 <= j <= i <= n-1) need be held\&. In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is component i * i / 2 + j of the storage array H_val will hold the value H_{ij} (and, by symmetry, H_{ji}) for 0 <= j <= i <= n-1\&.
.SS "Sparse co-ordinate storage format"
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored\&. For the l-th entry, 0 <= l <= ne-1, of H, its row index i, column index j and value H_{ij}, 0 <= j <= i <= n-1, are stored as the l-th components of the integer arrays H_row and H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as H_ne = ne\&. Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored\&.
.SS "Sparse row-wise storage format"
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those in row i+1\&. For the i-th row of H the i-th component of the integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row, while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries\&. The column indices j, 0 <= j <= i, and values H_{ij} of the entries in the i-th row are stored in components l = H_ptr(i), \&.\&.\&., H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively\&. Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored\&. For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than its predecessor\&.
