.SH "Introduction"
.PP
.SS "Purpose"
The arc package uses a \fBregularization method to find a (local) unconstrained minimizer of a differentiable objective function f(x) of many variables x\&.\fP The method offers the choice of direct and iterative solution of the key regularization subproblems, and is most suitable for large problems\&. First derivatives are required, and if second derivatives can be calculated, they will be exploited---if the product of second derivatives with a vector may be found, but not the derivatives themselves, that may also be exploited\&.

.SS "Terminology"
The \fIgradient\fP nabla_x f(x) of f(x) is the vector whose i-th component is partial f(x)/partial x_i\&. The \fIHessian\fP nabla_{xx} f(x) of f(x) is the symmetric matrix whose i,j-th entry is partial^2 f(x)/partial x_i partial x_j\&. The Hessian is \fIsparse\fP if a significant and useful proportion of the entries are universally zero\&.
.SS "Method"
An adaptive cubic regularization method is used\&. In this, an improvement to a current estimate of the required minimizer, x_k is sought by computing a step s_k\&. The step is chosen to approximately minimize a model m_k(s) of f(x_k + s) that includes a weighted term sigma_k ||s_k||^3 for some specified positive weight sigma_k\&. The quality of the resulting step s_k is assessed by computing the 'ratio' (f(x_k) - f(x_k + s_k))/ (m_k(0) - m_k(s_k))\&. The step is deemed to have succeeded if the ratio exceeds a given eta_s > 0, and in this case x_{k+1} = x_k + s_k\&. Otherwise x_{k+1} = x_k, and the weight is increased by powers of a given increase factor up to a given limit\&. If the ratio is larger than eta_v >= eta_d, the weight will be decreased by powers of a given decrease factor again up to a given limit\&. The method will terminate as soon as ||nabla_x f(x_k)|| is smaller than a specified value\&.
.PP
Either linear or quadratic models m_k(s) may be used\&. The former will be taken as the first two terms f(x_k) + s^T nabla_x f(x_k) of a Taylor series about x_k, while the latter uses an approximation to the first three terms f(x_k) + s^T nabla_x f(x_k) + 1/2 s^T B_k s, for which B_k is a symmetric approximation to the Hessian nabla_{xx}f(x_k); possible approximations include the true Hessian, limited-memory secant and sparsity approximations and a scaled identity matrix\&. Normally a two-norm regularization will be used, but this may change if preconditioning is employed\&.
.PP
An approximate minimizer of the cubic model is found using either a direct approach involving factorization or an iterative (conjugate-gradient/Lanczos) approach based on approximations to the required solution from a so-called Krlov subspace\&. The direct approach is based on the knowledge that the required solution satisfies the linear system of equations (B_k + lambda_k I) s_k = - nabla_x f(x_k) involving a scalar Lagrange multiplier lambda_k\&. This multiplier is found by uni-variate root finding, using a safeguarded Newton-like process, by the GALAHAD packages RQS or DPS (depending on the norm chosen)\&. The iterative approach uses the GALAHAD packag GLRT, and is best accelerated by preconditioning with good approximations to B_k using GALAHAD's PSLS\&. The iterative approach has the advantage that only matrix-vector products B_k v are required, and thus B_k is not required explicitly\&. However when factorizations of B_k are possible, the direct approach is often more efficient\&.

.SH "Call order"
.PP
To solve a given problem, functions from the arc package must be called in the following order:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBarc_initialize\fP - provide default control parameters and set up initial data structures
.IP "\(bu" 2

\fBarc_import\fP - set up problem data structures and fixed values
.IP "\(bu" 2

  See the examples section for illustrations of use.
  
.SH "Symmetric matrix storage formats"
.PP
The symmetric n by n matrix H = nabla_{xx}f may be presented and stored in a variety of formats\&. But crucially symmetry is exploited by only storing values from the lower triangular part (i\&.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal)\&.
.PP
Both C-style (0 based) and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed\&. Choose \fCcontrol\&.f_indexing\fP as \fCfalse\fP for C style and \fCtrue\fP for fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to indices for the corresponding fortran version\&.
.PP
Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C\&. This conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing\&.
.SS "Dense storage format"
The matrix H is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array\&. Since H is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part H_{ij} for 0 <= j <= i <= n-1) need be held\&. In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is component i * i / 2 + j of the storage array H_val will hold the value H_{ij} (and, by symmetry, H_{ji}) for 0 <= j <= i <= n-1\&.
.SS "Sparse co-ordinate storage format"
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored\&. For the l-th entry, 0 <= l <= ne-1, of H, its row index i, column index j and value H_{ij}, 0 <= j <= i <= n-1, are stored as the l-th components of the integer arrays H_row and H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as H_ne = ne\&. Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored\&.
.SS "Sparse row-wise storage format"
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those in row i+1\&. For the i-th row of H the i-th component of the integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row, while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries\&. The column indices j, 0 <= j <= i, and values H_{ij} of the entries in the i-th row are stored in components l = H_ptr(i), \&.\&.\&., H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively\&. Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored\&. For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than its predecessor\&.
