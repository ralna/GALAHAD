.SS "Purpose"
Given a real m by n matrix A, a real m vector b and scalars sigma>0 and p >= 2, this package finds an \fBapproximate minimizer of the regularized linear-least-squares objective function 1/2|| A x - b||_2^2 + \\frac{1}{p} sigma || x ||_2^p\&. \fP This problem commonly occurs as a subproblem in nonlinear optimization calculations involving cubic regularization, and may be used to regularize the solution of under-determined or ill-conditioned linear least-squares problems\&. The method may be suitable for large m and/or n as no factorization involving A is required\&. Reverse communication is used to obtain matrix-vector products of the form u + A v and v + A^T u\&.

.SS "Terminology"
The required solution x necessarily satisfies the optimality condition A^T ( A x - b ) + lambda x = 0, where the multiplier lambda = sigma ||x||_2^{p-2}\&.
.SS "Method"
The method is iterative\&. Starting with the vector u_1 = b, a bi-diagonalisation process is used to generate the vectors v_k and u_k+1 so that the n by k matrix V_k = ( v_1 \&.\&.\&. v_k) and the m by (k+1) matrix U_k = ( u_1 \&.\&.\&. u_{k+1}) together satisfy \[A V_k = U_{k+1} B_k \;\mbox{and}\; b = ||b||_2 U_{k+1} e_1\]  
\n
\n
 where B_k is (k+1) by k and lower bi-diagonal, U_k and V_k have orthonormal columns and e_1 is the first unit vector\&. The solution sought is of the form x_k = V_k y_k, where y_k solves the bi-diagonal regularized least-squares problem \[(1) \;\;\; \min 1/2 || B_k y - ||b|| e_1 ||_2^2 + \frac{1}{p} sigma || y ||_2^p.\]  
\n
   (1) min 1/2 || B_k y - ||b|| e_1 ||_2^2  + 1/p sigma || y||^p_2.
\n
 To minimize (1), the optimality conditions \[( B_k^T ( B_k^{} y(lambda) - ||b|| e_1^{} ) + lambda y(lambda) = 0,\]  
\n
\n
 where lambda = sigma ||y(lambda)||_2^{p-2} , are used as the basis of an iteration\&. The vector y(lambda) is equivalently the solution to the regularized least-squares problem \[(2) \;\;\; \min \left || \vect{ B_k \\ lambda^{1/2} I } y - ||b|| e_1^{} \right ||_2.\]  
\n
    (2)    min  ||  B_k y - ||b|| e_1 ||
                ||    lambda^{1/2} y  ||
\n
 Thus, given an estimate lambda >= 0, (2) may be efficiently solved to give y(lambda)\&. It is then simply a matter of adjusting lambda (for example by a Newton-like process) to solve the scalar nonlinear equation \[(3) \;\;\; \theta(lambda) =|| y(lambda) ||_2^{p-2} - \frac{lambda}{sigma} = 0.\]  
\n
   (3)   theta(lambda) = || y(lambda) ||_2^{p-2} - lambda/sigma = 0.
\n
 In practice (3) is reformulated, and a more rapidly converging iteration is used\&. Having found y_k, a second pass in which x_k = V_k y_k is regenerated is needed---this need only be done once x_k has implicitly deemed to be sufficiently close to optimality\&. As this second pass is an additional expense, a record is kept of the optimal objective function values for each value of k, and the second pass is only performed so far as to ensure a given fraction of the final optimal objective value\&. Large savings may be made in the second pass by choosing the required fraction to be significantly smaller than one\&.
.PP
Special code is used in the special case p=2, as in this case a single pass suffices\&.
