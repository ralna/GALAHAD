.SS "Purpose"
Given a sequence of vectors    
{s_k} and {y_k} and scalars {delta_k},
 \fBobtain the product of a limited-memory secant approximation H_k (or its inverse) with a given vector\fP, using one of a variety of well-established formulae\&.
.PP
Currently, only the control and inform parameters are exposed; these are provided and used by other GALAHAD packages with C interfaces\&.

.SS "Method"
Given a sequence of vectors    
{s_k} and {y_k} and scalars {delta_k},
 a limited-memory secant approximation H_k is chosen so that H_{\\max(k-m,0)} = \\delta_k I, H_{k-j} s_{k-j} = y_{k-j} and || H_{k-j+1} - H_{k-j}|| is ``small'' for j = \\min(k-1,m-1), \&.\&.\&., 0\&. Different ways of quantifying ``small'' distinguish different methods, but the crucial observation is that it is possible to construct H_k quickly from {s_k}, {y_k} and \\delta_k, and to apply it and its inverse to a given vector v\&. It is also possible to apply similar formulae to the ``shifted'' matrix H_k + lambda_k I that occurs in trust-region methods\&.
.SS "Reference"
The basic methods are those given by
