.SS "Purpose"
This package uses a \fBregularization method to find a (local) unconstrained minimizer of a differentiable weighted sum-of-squares objective function \[{f(x) := 1/2 \sum_{i=1}^m w_i^{} c_i^2(x) = 1/2 ||c(x)||^2_W}\]  
  \n
  f(x):= 1/2 sum_{i=1}^m w_i c_i^2(x) = 1/2 ||c(x)||^2_W
  \n
 of many variables x involving positive weights w_i, {i=1,\&.\&.\&.,m}\&.\fP The method offers the choice of direct and iterative solution of the key regularization subproblems, and is most suitable for large problems\&. First derivatives of the \fIresidual function\fP c(x) are required, and if second derivatives of the c_i(x) can be calculated, they may be exploited---if suitable products of the first or second derivatives with a vector may be found but not the derivatives themselves, that can also be used to advantage\&.

.SS "Terminology"
The \fIgradient\fP nabla_x f(x) of a function f(x) is the vector whose i-th component is partial f(x)/partial x_i\&. The \fIHessian\fP nabla_{xx} f(x) of f(x) is the symmetric matrix whose i,j-th entry is partial^2 f(x)/partial x_i partial x_j\&. The Hessian is \fIsparse\fP if a significant and useful proportion of the entries are universally zero\&.
.PP
The algorithm used by the package is iterative\&. From the current best estimate of the minimizer x_k, a trial improved point x_k + s_k is sought\&. The correction s_k is chosen to improve a model m_k(s) of the stabilised objective function f_{rho,p}(x_k+s) built around the objective function f(x_k+s) built around x_k\&. The model is the sum of two basic components, a suitable approximation t_k(s) of f(x_k+s), another approximation of (rho/r) ||x_k+s||_r^r (if rho > 0), and a regularization term (sigma_k/p) ||s||_{S_k}^p involving a weight sigma_k, power p and a norm ||s||_{S_k} := sqrt{s^T S_k s} for a given positive definite scaling matrix S_k that is included to prevent large corrections\&. The weight sigma_k is adjusted as the algorithm progresses to ensure convergence\&.
.PP
The model t_k(s) is a truncated Taylor-series approximation, and this relies on being able to compute or estimate derivatives of c(x)\&. Various models are provided, and each has different derivative requirements\&. We denote the m by n \fIresidual Jacobian\fP J(x) = nabla_x c(x) as the matrix whose i,j-th component \[J(x)_{i,j} := partial c_i(x) / partial x_j \;\; \mbox{for $i=1,...,m$ and $j=1,...,n$.}\]  
  \n
  J(x)_{i,j} := partial c_i(x) / partial x_j 
  \n
  for i=1,...,m and j=1,...,n. For a given m-vector y, the \fIweighted-residual Hessian\fP is the sum \[H(x,y) := \sum_{l=1}^m y_l H_l(x), \;\; \mbox{where}\;\; H_l(x)_{i,j} := partial^2 c_l(x) / partial x_i partial x_j \;\; \mbox{for $i,j=1,...,n$}\]  
  \n
  H(x,y) := sum_{l=1}^m y_l H_l(x), where 
  \n
  H_l(x)_{i,j} := partial^2 c_l(x) / partial x_i partial x_j
  \n
for i,j=1,...,n is the Hessian of c_l(x)\&. Finally, for a given vector v, we define the \fIresidual-Hessians-vector product matrix\fP \[P(x,v) := (H_1(x) v, ..., H_m(x) v).\]  
  \n
  P(x,v) := (H_1(x) v, ..., H_m(x) v).
  \n
 The models t_k(s) provided are,
.IP "1." 4
the first-order Taylor approximation f(x_k) + g(x_k)^T s, where g(x) = J^T(x) W c(x),
.IP "2." 4
a barely second-order approximation f(x_k) + g(x_k)^T s + 1/2 s^T W s,
.IP "3." 4
the Gauss-Newton approximation 1/2 || c(x_k) + J(x_k) s||^2_W,
.IP "4." 4
the Newton (second-order Taylor) approximation f(x_k) + g(x_k)^T s + 1/2 s^T [ J^T(x_k) W J(x_k) + H(x_k,W c(x_k))] s, and
.IP "5." 4
the tensor Gauss-Newton approximation 1/2 || c(x_k) + J(x_k) s + 1/2 s^T * P(x_k,s) ||^2_W, where the i-th component of s^T * P(x_k,s) is shorthand for the scalar s^T H_i(x_k) s, where W is the diagonal matrix of weights w_i, i = 1, \&.\&.\&. m\&.

Access to a particular model requires that the user is either able to provide the derivatives needed (``\fImatrix available\fP'') or that the products of these derivatives (and their transposes) with specified vectors are possible (``\fImatrix free\fP'')\&.
.SS "Method"
An adaptive regularization method is used\&. In this, an improvement to a current estimate of the required minimizer, x_k is sought by computing a step s_k\&. The step is chosen to approximately minimize a model t_k(s) of f_{rho,r}(x_k+s) that includes a weighted regularization term (sigma_k/p) ||s||_{S_k}^p for some specified positive weight sigma_k\&. The quality of the resulting step s_k is assessed by computing the 'ratio' %(f_{rho,p}(x_k) - f_{rho,p}(x_k+s_k))/(t_k(0)-t_k(s_k))\&. (f(x_k) - f(x_k + s_k))/(t_k(0) - t_k(s_k))\&. The step is deemed to have succeeded if the ratio exceeds a given eta_s > 0, and in this case x_{k+1} = x_k + s_k\&. Otherwise x_{k+1} = x_k, and the weight is increased by powers of a given increase factor up to a given limit\&. If the ratio is larger than eta_v >= eta_d, the weight will be decreased by powers of a given decrease factor again up to a given limit\&. The method will terminate as soon as f(x_k) or ||nabla_x f(x_k)|| is smaller than a specified value\&.
.PP
A choice of linear, quadratic or quartic models t_k(s) is available (see the \fBTerminology\fP section), and normally a two-norm regularization will be used, but this may change if preconditioning is employed\&.
.PP
If linear or quadratic models are employed, an appropriate, approximate model minimizer is found using either a direct approach involving factorization of a shift of the model Hessian B_k or an iterative (conjugate-gradient/Lanczos) approach based on approximations to the required solution from a so-called Krlov subspace\&. The direct approach is based on the knowledge that the required solution satisfies the linear system of equations (B_k + lambda_k I) s_k = - nabla_x f(x_k) involving a scalar Lagrange multiplier lambda_k\&. This multiplier is found by uni-variate root finding, using a safeguarded Newton-like process, by the GALAHAD packages RQS\&. The iterative approach uses the GALAHAD packag GLRT, and is best accelerated by preconditioning with good approximations to the Hessian of the model using GALAHAD's PSLS\&. The iterative approach has the advantage that only Hessian matrix-vector products are required, and thus the Hessian B_k is not required explicitly\&. However when factorizations of the Hessian are possible, the direct approach is often more efficient\&.
.PP
When a quartic model is used, the model is itself of least-squares form, and the package calls itself recursively to approximately minimize its model\&. The quartic model often gives a better approximation, but at the cost of more involved derivative requirements\&.

.SS "Unsymmetric matrix storage formats"
The unsymmetric m by n Jacobian matrix J = nabla_x c(x) and the residual-Hessians-vector product matrix $P(x,v)$ may be presented and stored in a variety of convenient input formats\&. Let A be J or P as appropriate\&.
.PP
Both C-style (0 based) and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed\&. Choose \fCcontrol\&.f_indexing\fP as \fCfalse\fP for C style and \fCtrue\fP for fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to indices for the corresponding fortran version\&.
.PP
Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C\&. This conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing\&.
.SS "Dense storage format"
The matrix A is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array\&. In this case, component n * i + j of the storage array A_val will hold the value A_{ij} for 0 <= i <= m-1, 0 <= j <= n-1\&.
.SS "Dense by columns storage format"
The matrix A is stored as a compact dense matrix by columns, that is, the values of the entries of each column in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array\&. In this case, component m * j + i of the storage array A_val will hold the value A_{ij} for 0 <= i <= m-1, 0 <= j <= n-1\&.
.SS "Sparse co-ordinate storage format"
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored\&. For the l-th entry, 0 <= l <= ne-1, of A, its row index i, column index j and value A_{ij}, 0 <= i <= m-1, 0 <= j <= n-1, are stored as the l-th components of the integer arrays A_row and A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as A_ne = ne\&.
.SS "Sparse row-wise storage format"
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those in row i+1\&. For the i-th row of A the i-th component of the integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row, while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries plus one\&. The column indices j, 0 <= j <= n-1, and values A_{ij} of the nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components l = A_ptr(i), \&.\&.\&., A_ptr(i+1)-1, 0 <= i <= m-1, of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively\&. For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than its predecessor\&.
.SS "Sparse column-wise storage format"
Once again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in column j appear directly before those in column j+1\&. For the j-th column of A the j-th component of the integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this column, while A_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one\&. The row indices i, 0 <= i <= m-1, and values A_{ij} of the nonzero entries in the j-th columnsare stored in components l = A_ptr(j), \&.\&.\&., A_ptr(j+1)-1, 0 <= j <= n-1, of the integer array A_row, and real array A_val, respectively\&. As before, for sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than the co-ordinate format\&. 
.SS "Symmetric matrix storage formats"
Likewise, the symmetric n by n weighted-residual Hessian matrix H = H(x,y) may be presented and stored in a variety of formats\&. But crucially symmetry is exploited by only storing values from the lower triangular part (i\&.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal)\&.
.SS "Dense storage format"
The matrix H is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array\&. Since H is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part h_{ij} for 0 <= j <= i <= n-1) need be held\&. In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is component i * i / 2 + j of the storage array H_val will hold the value h_{ij} (and, by symmetry, h_{ji}) for 0 <= j <= i <= n-1\&.
.SS "Sparse co-ordinate storage format"
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored\&. For the l-th entry, 0 <= l <= ne-1, of H, its row index i, column index j and value h_{ij}, 0 <= j <= i <= n-1, are stored as the l-th components of the integer arrays H_row and H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as H_ne = ne\&. Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored\&.
.SS "Sparse row-wise storage format"
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those in row i+1\&. For the i-th row of H the i-th component of the integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row, while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one\&. The column indices j, 0 <= j <= i, and values h_{ij} of the entries in the i-th row are stored in components l = H_ptr(i), \&.\&.\&., H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively\&. Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored\&. For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than its predecessor\&.
.SS "Diagonal storage format"
If H is diagonal (i\&.e\&., H_{ij} = 0 for all 0 <= i /= j <= n-1) only the diagonals entries H_{ii}, 0 <= i <= n-1 need be stored, and the first n components of the array H_val may be used for the purpose\&.
.SS "Multiples of the identity storage format"
If H is a multiple of the identity matrix, (i\&.e\&., H = alpha I where I is the n by n identity matrix and alpha is a scalar), it suffices to store alpha as the first component of H_val\&.
.SS "The identity matrix format"
If H is the identity matrix, no values need be stored\&.
.SS "The zero matrix format"
The same is true if H is the zero matrix\&.

If the evaluation is impossible at x, return should be set to a nonzero value\&. The Hessians have already been evaluated or used at x if got_h is true\&. Data may be passed into \fCeval_hprod\fP via the structure \fCuserdata\fP\&.
.br
\fIp_ne\fP is a scalar variable of type int, that holds the number of entries in the residual-Hessians-vector product matrix P if it is used\&.
