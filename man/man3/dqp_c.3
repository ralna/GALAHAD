.SS "Purpose"
This package uses a dual gradient-projection interior-point method to solve the \fBstrictly convex quadratic programming problem\fP \[(0) \;\;\; \mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = 1/2 x^T H x + g^T x + f \]  
  \n
  (0)   minimize q(x) := 1/2 x^T H x + g^T x + f
  \n
 or the \fBshifted least-distance problem\fP \[\mbox{minimize}\;\; 1/2 \sum_{j=1}^n w_j^2 ( x_j^{ } - x_j^0 )^2 + g^T x + f \]  
  \n
   minimize 1/2 \sum_{j=1}^n w_j^2 ( x_j - x_j^0 )^2  + g^T x + f
  \n
 subject to the general linear constraints \[c_i^l <= a_i^Tx <= c_i^u, \;\;\; i = 1, ... , m,\]  
  \n
   c_i^l \[<=] a_i^Tx \[<=] c_i^u, i = 1, ... , m,
  \n
 and the simple bound constraints \[x_j^l <= x_j^{ } <= x_j^u, \;\;\; j = 1, ... , n,\]  
  \n
   x_j^l \[<=] x_j \[<=] x_j^u, j = 1, ... , n,
  \n
 where the n by n symmetric, positive-definite matrix H, the vectors g, w, x^0, a_i, c^l, c^u, x^l, x^u and the scalar f are given\&. Any of the constraint bounds c_i^l, c_i^u, x_j^l and x_j^u may be infinite\&. Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix H or the matrix A of vectors a_i\&.

.SS "Terminology"
The required solution x necessarily satisfies the primal optimality conditions \[\mbox{(1a) $\hspace{66mm} A x = c\hspace{66mm}$}\]  
  \n
  (1a) A x = c
  \n
 and \[\mbox{(1b) $\hspace{52mm} c^l <= c <= c^u, \;\; x^l <= x <= x^u,\hspace{52mm}$} \]  
  \n
  (1b) c^l \[<=] c \[<=] c^u, x^l \[<=] x \[<=] x^u,
  \n
 the dual optimality conditions \[\mbox{(2a) $\hspace{3mm} H x + g = A^T y + z \;\; (\mbox{or} \;\; W^{2} (x -x^0) + g = A^T y + z \;\; \mbox{for the shifted-least-distance type objective})$}\]  
  \n
  (2a) H x + g = A^T y + z
       (or W^2 (x -x^0) + g = A^T y + z
        for the shifted-least-distance type objective)
  \n
 where \[\mbox{(2b) $\hspace{24mm} y = y^l + y^u, \;\; z = z^l + z^u, \,\, y^l >= 0 , \;\; y^u <= 0 , \;\; z^l >= 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\; z^u <= 0,\hspace{24mm}$} \]  
  \n
   (2b) y = y^l + y^u, z = z^l + z^u, y^l \[>=] 0, y^u \[<=] 0,
        z^l \[>=] 0 and z^u \[<=] 0,
  \n
 and the complementary slackness conditions \[\mbox{(3) $\hspace{12mm} ( A x - c^l )^T y^l = 0 ,\;\; ( A x - c^u )^T y^u = 0 ,\;\; (x -x^l )^T z^l = 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\; (x -x^u )^T z^u = 0,\hspace{12mm} $}\]  
  \n
  (3) (A x - c^l)^T y^l = 0, (A x - c^u)^T y^u = 0,
      (x -x^l)^T z^l = 0 and (x -x^u)^T z^u = 0,
  \n
 where the diagonal matrix W^2 has diagonal entries w_j^2, j = 1, \&.\&.\&. , n, where the vectors y and z are known as the Lagrange multipliers for the general linear constraints, and the dual variables for the bounds, respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold component-wise\&.
.SS "Method"
Dual gradient-projection methods solve (0) by instead solving the dual quadratic program    
  \n
  (4) minimize q^D(y^l, y^u, z^l, z^u) =
     1/2 [ ( y^l  + y^u )^T A + ( z^l + z^u ]^T ) H^{-1}
      [ A^T ( y^l  + y^u ) + z^l + z^u ]
     - [ ( y^l  + y^u )^T A + ( z^l + z^u ]^T ) H^{-1} g
     - ( c^{l T} y^l + c^{u T} y^u +  x^{l T} z^l + x^{u T} z^u
     subject to ( y^l, z^l ) >= 0 and(y^u, z^u) <= 0,
  \n
 and then recovering the required solution from the linear system \[\mbox{$H x = - g + A^T ( y^l + y^u ) + z^l + z^u.$}\]  
  \n
   H x = - g + A^T ( y^l  + y^u ) + z^l + z^u.
  \n
 The dual problem (4) is solved by an accelerated gradient-projection method comprising of alternating phases in which (i) the current projected dual gradient is traced downhill (the 'arc search') as far as possible and (ii) the dual variables that are currently on their bounds are temporarily fixed and the unconstrained minimizer of q^D(y^l, y^u, z^l, z^u) with respect to the remaining variables is sought; the minimizer in the second phase may itself need to be projected back into the dual feasible region (either using a brute-force backtrack or a second arc search)\&.
.PP
Both phases require the solution of sparse systems of symmetric linear equations, and these are handled by the GALAHAD matrix factorization package SBLS or the GALAHAD conjugate-gradient package GLTR\&. The systems are commonly singular, and this leads to a requirement to find the Fredholm Alternative for the given matrix and its right-hand side\&. In the non-singular case, there is an option to update existing factorizations using the 'Schur-complement' approach given by the GALAHAD package SCU\&.
.PP
Optionally, the problem may be pre-processed temporarily to eliminate dependentconstraints using the GALAHAD package FDC\&. This may improve the performance of the subsequent iteration\&.

  See the examples section for illustrations of use.
  
.SS "Unsymmetric matrix storage formats"
The unsymmetric m by n constraint matrix A may be presented and stored in a variety of convenient input formats\&.
.PP
Both C-style (0 based) and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed\&. Choose \fCcontrol\&.f_indexing\fP as \fCfalse\fP for C style and \fCtrue\fP for fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to indices for the corresponding fortran version\&.
.PP
Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C\&. This conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing\&.
.SS "Dense storage format"
The matrix A is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array\&. In this case, component n * i + j of the storage array A_val will hold the value A_{ij} for 0 <= i <= m-1, 0 <= j <= n-1\&.
.SS "Sparse co-ordinate storage format"
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored\&. For the l-th entry, 0 <= l <= ne-1, of A, its row index i, column index j and value A_{ij}, 0 <= i <= m-1, 0 <= j <= n-1, are stored as the l-th components of the integer arrays A_row and A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as A_ne = ne\&.
.SS "Sparse row-wise storage format"
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those in row i+1\&. For the i-th row of A the i-th component of the integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row, while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries\&. The column indices j, 0 <= j <= n-1, and values A_{ij} of the nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components l = A_ptr(i), \&.\&.\&., A_ptr(i+1)-1, 0 <= i <= m-1, of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively\&. For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than its predecessor\&.
.SS "Symmetric matrix storage formats"
Likewise, the symmetric n by n objective Hessian matrix H may be presented and stored in a variety of formats\&. But crucially symmetry is exploited by only storing values from the lower triangular part (i\&.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal)\&.
.SS "Dense storage format"
The matrix H is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array\&. Since H is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part h_{ij} for 0 <= j <= i <= n-1) need be held\&. In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is component i * i / 2 + j of the storage array H_val will hold the value h_{ij} (and, by symmetry, h_{ji}) for 0 <= j <= i <= n-1\&.
.SS "Sparse co-ordinate storage format"
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored\&. For the l-th entry, 0 <= l <= ne-1, of H, its row index i, column index j and value h_{ij}, 0 <= j <= i <= n-1, are stored as the l-th components of the integer arrays H_row and H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as H_ne = ne\&. Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored\&.
.SS "Sparse row-wise storage format"
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those in row i+1\&. For the i-th row of H the i-th component of the integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row, while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries\&. The column indices j, 0 <= j <= i, and values h_{ij} of the entries in the i-th row are stored in components l = H_ptr(i), \&.\&.\&., H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively\&. Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored\&. For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than its predecessor\&.
.SS "Diagonal storage format"
If H is diagonal (i\&.e\&., H_{ij} = 0 for all 0 <= i /= j <= n-1) only the diagonals entries H_{ii}, 0 <= i <= n-1 need be stored, and the first n components of the array H_val may be used for the purpose\&.
.SS "Multiples of the identity storage format"
If H is a multiple of the identity matrix, (i\&.e\&., H = alpha I where I is the n by n identity matrix and alpha is a scalar), it suffices to store alpha as the first component of H_val\&.
.SS "The identity matrix format"
If H is the identity matrix, no values need be stored\&.
