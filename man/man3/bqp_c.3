.SH "Introduction"
.PP
.SS "Purpose"
This package uses a preconditioned, projected-gradient method to solve the \fBconvex bound-constrained quadratic programming problem\fP \[\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = 1/2 x^T H x + g^T x + f \]  
  \n
  minimize q(x) := 1/2 x^T H x + g^T x + f
  \n
 subject to the simple bound constraints \[x_j^l <= x_j <= x_j^u, \;\;\; j = 1, ... , n,\]  
  \n
   x_j^l \[<=] x_j \[<=] x_j^u, j = 1, ... , n,
  \n
 where the n by n symmetric postive semi-definite matrix H, the vectors g, x^l, x^u and the scalar f are given\&. Any of the constraint bounds x_j^l and x_j^u may be infinite\&. Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix H; the matrix need not be provided as there are options to obtain matrix-vector products involving H by reverse communication\&.

.SS "Terminology"
The required solution x necessarily satisfies the primal optimality conditions \[x^l <= x <= x^u,\]  
  \n
   x^l \[<=] x \[<=] x^u,
  \n
 the dual optimality conditions \[H x + g = z\]  
  \n
   H x + g = z
  \n
 where \[ z = z^l + z^u, \,\, z^l >= 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\; z^u <= 0,\]  
  \n
   z = z^l + z^u, z^l \[>=] 0 and z^u \[<=] 0,
  \n
 and the complementary slackness conditions \[(x -x^l )^{T} z^l = 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\; (x -x^u )^{T} z^u = 0,\hspace{12mm} \]  
  \n
  (x -x^l)^T z^l = 0 and (x -x^u)^T z^u = 0,
  \n
 where the vector z is known as the dual variables for the bounds, respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold component-wise\&.
.SS "Method"
The method is iterative\&. Each iteration proceeds in two stages\&. Firstly, the so-called generalized Cauchy point for the quadratic objective is found\&. (The purpose of this point is to ensure that the algorithm converges and that the set of bounds which are satisfied as equations at the solution is rapidly identified\&.) Thereafter an improvement to the objective is sought using either a direct-matrix or truncated conjugate-gradient algorithm\&.

.SS "Call order"
To solve a given problem, functions from the bqp package must be called in the following order:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBbqp_initialize\fP - provide default control parameters and set up initial data structures
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBbqp_read_specfile\fP (optional) - override control values by reading replacement values from a file
.IP "\(bu" 2
set up problem data structures and fixed values by caling one of
.IP "  \(bu" 4
\fBbqp_import\fP - in the case that H is explicitly available
.IP "  \(bu" 4
\fBbqp_import_without_h\fP - in the case that only the effect of applying H to a vector is possible
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBbqp_reset_control\fP (optional) - possibly change control parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved
.IP "\(bu" 2
solve the problem by calling one of
.IP "  \(bu" 4
\fBbqp_solve_given_h\fP - solve the problem using values of H
.IP "  \(bu" 4
\fBbqp_solve_reverse_h_prod\fP - solve the problem by returning to the caller for products of H with specified vectors
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBbqp_information\fP (optional) - recover information about the solution and solution process
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBbqp_terminate\fP - deallocate data structures
.PP
.PP
   
  See the examples section for illustrations of use.
  
.SS "Symmetric matrix storage formats"
If it is explicitly available, the symmetric n by n objective Hessian matrix H may be presented and stored in a variety of formats\&. But crucially symmetry is exploited by only storing values from the lower triangular part (i\&.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal)\&.
.SS "Dense storage format"
The matrix H is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array\&. Since H is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part h_{ij} for 0 <= j <= i <= n-1) need be held\&. In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is component i * i / 2 + j of the storage array H_val will hold the value h_{ij} (and, by symmetry, h_{ji}) for 0 <= j <= i <= n-1\&.
.SS "Sparse co-ordinate storage format"
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored\&. For the l-th entry, 0 <= l <= ne-1, of H, its row index i, column index j and value h_{ij}, 0 <= j <= i <= n-1, are stored as the l-th components of the integer arrays H_row and H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as H_ne = ne\&. Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored\&.
.SS "Sparse row-wise storage format"
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those in row i+1\&. For the i-th row of H the i-th component of the integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row, while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries\&. The column indices j, 0 <= j <= i, and values h_{ij} of the entries in the i-th row are stored in components l = H_ptr(i), \&.\&.\&., H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively\&. Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored\&. For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than its predecessor\&.
.SS "Diagonal storage format"
If H is diagonal (i\&.e\&., H_{ij} = 0 for all 0 <= i /= j <= n-1) only the diagonals entries H_{ii}, 0 <= i <= n-1 need be stored, and the first n components of the array H_val may be used for the purpose\&.
