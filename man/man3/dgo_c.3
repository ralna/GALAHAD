.SH "Introduction"
.PP
.SS "Purpose"
The dgo package uses a \fBdeterministic partition-and-bound trust-region method to find an approximation to the global minimizer of a differentiable objective function f(x) of n variables x, subject to a finite set of simple bounds x^l <= x <= x^u on the variables\&.\fP The method offers the choice of direct and iterative solution of the key trust-region subproblems, and is suitable for large problems\&. First derivatives are required, and if second derivatives can be calculated, they will be exploited---if the product of second derivatives with a vector may be found but not the derivatives themselves, that may also be exploited\&.
.PP
Although there are theoretical guarantees, these may require a large number of evaluations as the dimension and nonconvexity increase\&. The alternative GALAHAD package bgo may sometimes be preferred\&.

.SS "Terminology"
The \fIgradient\fP nabla_x f(x) of f(x) is the vector whose i-th component is partial f(x)/partial x_i\&. The \fIHessian\fP nabla_{xx} f(x) of f(x) is the symmetric matrix whose i,j-th entry is partial^2 f(x)/partial x_i partial x_j\&. The Hessian is \fIsparse\fP if a significant and useful proportion of the entries are universally zero\&.
.SS "Method"
Starting with the initial box x^l <= x <= x^u, a sequence of boxes is generated by considering the current set, and partitioning a promising candidate into three equally-sized sub-boxes by splitting along one of the box dimensions\&. Each partition requires only a pair of new function and derivative evaluations, and these values, together with estimates of Lipschitz constants, makes it possible to remove other boxes from further consideration as soon as they cannot contain a global minimizer\&. Efficient control of the dictionary of vertices of the sub-boxes is handled using a suitable hashing procedure provided by the GALAHAD package hash; each sub-box is indexed by the concatenated coordinates of a pair of opposite vertices\&. At various stages, local minimization in a promising sub-box, using the GALAHAD package trb, may be used to improve the best-known upper bound on the global minimizer\&. If n=1, the specialised GALAHAD univariate global minimization package ugo is called directly\&.
.PP
We reiterate that although there are theoretical guarantees, these may require a large number of evaluations as the dimension and nonconvexity increase\&. Thus the method should best be viewed as a heuristic to try to find a reasonable approximation of the global minimum\&.

.SH "Call order"
.PP
To solve a given problem, functions from the dgo package must be called in the following order:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBdgo_initialize\fP - provide default control parameters and set up initial data structures
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBdgo_read_specfile\fP (optional) - override control values by reading replacement values from a file

\fBdgo_import\fP - set up problem data structures and fixed values
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBdgo_reset_control\fP (optional) - possibly change control parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved

  See the examples section for illustrations of use.
  
.SH "Symmetric matrix storage formats"
.PP
The symmetric n by n matrix H = nabla_{xx}f may be presented and stored in a variety of formats\&. But crucially symmetry is exploited by only storing values from the lower triangular part (i\&.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal)\&.
.PP
Both C-style (0 based) and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed\&. Choose \fCcontrol\&.f_indexing\fP as \fCfalse\fP for C style and \fCtrue\fP for fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to indices for the corresponding fortran version\&.
.PP
Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C\&. This conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing\&.
.SS "Dense storage format"
The matrix H is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array\&. Since H is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part H_{ij} for 0 <= j <= i <= n-1) need be held\&. In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is component i * i / 2 + j of the storage array H_val will hold the value H_{ij} (and, by symmetry, H_{ji}) for 0 <= j <= i <= n-1\&.
.SS "Sparse co-ordinate storage format"
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored\&. For the l-th entry, 0 <= l <= ne-1, of H, its row index i, column index j and value H_{ij}, 0 <= j <= i <= n-1, are stored as the l-th components of the integer arrays H_row and H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as H_ne = ne\&. Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored\&.
.SS "Sparse row-wise storage format"
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those in row i+1\&. For the i-th row of H the i-th component of the integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row, while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries\&. The column indices j, 0 <= j <= i, and values H_{ij} of the entries in the i-th row are stored in components l = H_ptr(i), \&.\&.\&., H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively\&. Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored\&. For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than its predecessor\&.
