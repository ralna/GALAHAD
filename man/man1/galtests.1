.SH NAME
\fBgaltests\fR \- Decode a sequence of SIF test examples, run
a GALAHAD package on each in turn and report a summary of the results
as they appear
.SH USAGE
.B galtests architecture package test_set [options]
,

where
.B architecture
is a string of the form machine.os.compiler

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B galtests
decodes a sequence of user-defined SIF files, and calls
.B gal
to apply the relevant GALAHAD large-scale nonlinear-optimization
packags for each in turn.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.TP 1i
.B \-h
Print a list of these options and stop execution.
.TP 1i
.B \-o
Before the tests start, the non-default values from the relevant package
options file
.B option_file
will be added to output summary file
.TP
.BI \-l " lines"
Specify the number
.IR lines
of lines from the end of the output file that will be printed to the
terminal on completeion of each run
(1 line; the default)
