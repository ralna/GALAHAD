.TH rbgal 1
.SH NAME
\fBrbgal\fR \- Read a Rutherford-Boeing sparse matrix data file and 
run a GALAHAD package on the result
.SH USAGE
.B rbgal architecture package
[options]
.IR file[.rb] 
or 
file[.tar[.gz]],

where
.B architecture
is a string of the form machine.os.compiler
indicating the machine/operating system/compiler combination to be used and
.B package
indicates the package required.

The Rutherford-Boeing data may be presented either as a text file of the form
file.[rb] or as a (compressed) UNIX tar file file.[tar[.gz]] in the
current directory. If the name file presented has no suffix, files named
file, file.rb, file.tar.gz and file.tar will be examined in turn until
a suitable match is found.

The name
.B architecture
must match that of one of the files in the directory
$GALAHAD/bin/sys , while
.B package
may be one of
.LP
.TP 1i
.BI sls
SLS for real symmetric matrices
.TP 1i
.BI uls
ULS for real unsymmetric matrices (interface forthcoming)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B rbgal
reads a user-defined Rutherford-Boeing problem-data file, and runs one of the 
GALAHAD large-scale linear-equation solver packages on the result.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.TP 1i
.BI \-s
Run the single precision version of the package. The default is
to run the double precision version.
.TP
.B \-h or \-\-help
Print a list of these options and stop execution.
.TP
.BI \-u
Update the option specification file to incorporate the latest options.
The default is to leave the file alone (and create it if it does not exist).
.TP
.B \-k
Keep the executable after use. A second file newfile.rb may then be
processed by issuing the command
.ce 2

.B ./architecture.package < \fR newfile[.rb] .
.ce 0

.TP
.B \-m
Check for memory leaks (if possible).
.TP
.B \-p
Profile the code (if possible).
.TP
.BI \-o " output"
Specify the
.IR output
level, which must be one of
.B 0
(no output; the default)
.B 1
(a brief description of the steps performed)
.B -1
(a full debugging output, for experts only).
.TP
.BI \-l " secs"
Set a limit of
.IR secs
seconds on the GALAHAD run. The default is 99999999 seconds.
.SH FILES
.TP 20
.BI achitecture.package
executable output file created by rbgal
.TP
.IB RUN package .SPC
user-supplied option specification file
.TP
.IB SOLUTION.d
file containing solution created by rbgal
.TP
.IB SUMMARY.d
file containing summary of solution created by rbgal
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
Environment variables may be used to override default external library settings.
By default these are unset, but if required they should be exported after
being set.
.TP
.IB BLASLIB
If there are compiled, library versions of the blas
(basic linear algebra subprograms), set BLASLIB to a list of
names of the object library suffix -lx, where the object library
libx.a contains relevant blas. For instance if the blas are
shared between object libraries libblas1.a and libblas2.a,
BLASLIB should be set to "-lblas1 -lblas2", noting that those in
libblas1.a will take precedence over those in libblas2.a.
If compiled blas are unavailable, BLASLIB should either be unset or set to "".
If the user wishes not to link blas separately, 
for example if they are provided by one of the other external packages, 
set BLASLIB to "-galahad_dummy",
.TP
.IB LAPACKLIB
If there are compiled, library versions of the LAPACK library
set LAPACKLIB to a list of names of the object library suffix -lx,
where the object library libx.a contains relevant lapack. For instance
if LAPACK is shared between object libraries liblapack1.a and liblapack2.a,
LAPACKLIB should be set to "-llapack1 -llapack2", noting that those in
liblapack1.a will take precedence over those in liblapack2.a. If compiled 
lapack are unavailable, LAPACKLIB should either be unset or set to "".
If the user wishes not to link lapack separately, 
for example if they are provided by one of the other external packages, 
set LAPACKLIB to "-galahad_dummy".
.TP
.IB HSLLIB
If there is a compiled, library version of the HSL Mathematical 
Software Library(formerly the Harwell Subroutine Library, 
https://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/), set HSLLIB to -lx, 
where the object library libx.a contains the relevant HSL packages. 
For instance if the HSL is contained in the object library libhsl.a, 
HSLLIB should be set to "-lhsl". If a compiled version of HSL 
is unavailable, HSLLIB should either be unset or set to "".
N.B. HSL is only required optionally, but is recommended as it provides
considerably improved performace for many GALAHAD packages.
.TP
.IB METISLIB
If there is a compiled, library version of the Metis (versions 4 or 5) graph
partitioning package (http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/), set
METISLIB to "-lgalahad_metis4 -lx" ( "-lgalahad_metis5 -lx" for version 5).
where the object library libx.a contains Metis.  For instance
if Metis 5 is contained in the object library libmetis.a, METISLIB should be
set to "-lgalahad_metis5 -lmetis".  If the library is in a "non-standard" 
place, METISLIB should also point to the full path to the library. 
For example, if libmetis.so is in the directory /mylibrary, METISLIB should
be set to "-L/mylibrary -lgalahad_metis5 -lmetis" If a compiled version 
of Metis is unavailable, METISLIB will be set to "-lgalahad_metis_dummy".
N.B. Metis is only required by HSL and some other supported sparse matrix 
packages.
.TP
.IB SPRALLIB
If there is a compiled, library version of the SPRAL sparse factorization
package (http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/asearchralna/), set SPRALLIB
to -lx, where the object library libx.so contains SPRAL.  For instance if
SPRAL is contained in the object library libspral.so, SPRALLIB should be
set to "-lspral". If the library is in a "non-standard place", SPRALLIB
should also point to the full path to the library. For example, if
libspral.so is in the directory /mylibrary, SPRALLIB should be set to
"-L/mylibrary -lspral" If a compiled version of SPRAL is unavailable,
SPRALLIB will be set to "-lgalahad_spral".
N.B. SPRAL is only optionally required but may improve performance.
In addition, amny parts of SPRAL are included as part of GALAHAD.
.TP
.IB PARDISOLIB
If there is a compiled, library version of the PARDISO sparse factorization
package (http://www.pardiso-project.org/) , set PARDISOLIB to -lx,
where the object library libx.so contains PARDISO.  For instance if PARDISO
is contained in the object library libpardiso.so, PARDISOLIB should be set to
"-lpardiso". If the library is in a "non-standard place", PARDISOLIB should
also point to the full path to the library. For example, if libpardiso.so
is in the directory /mylibrary, PARDISOLIB should be set to
"-L/mylibrary -lpardiso" If a compiled version of PARDISO is unavailable,
PARDISOLIB will be set to "-lgalahad_pardiso".
N.B. PARDISO is only optionally required but may improve performance.
.TP
.IB MKL_PARDISOLIB
If there is a compiled, library version of the MKL version of the PARDISO
sparse factorization package (http://www.pardiso-project.org/) , set
MKL_PARDISOLIB to -lx, where the object library libx.so contains PARDISO. For
instance if PARDISO is contained in the object library libmkl_intel_lp64.a
MKL_PARDISOLIB should be set to "-lmkl_intel_lp64". If the library is in a
"non-standard place", MKL_PARDISOLIB should also point to the full path to the
library. For example, if libmkl_intel_lp64.a is in the directory /mylibrary,
MKL_PARDISOLIB should be set to "-L/mylibrary -lmkl_intel_lp64"
If a compiled version of the MKL version of PARDISO is unavailable,
MKL_PARDISOLIB will be set to "-lgalahad_mkl_pardiso".
N.B. MKL PARDISO is only optionally required but may improve performance.
.TP
.IB WSMPLIB
If there is a compiled, library version of the WSMP sparse factorization
package (http://www.wsmp-project.org/) , set WSMPLIB to -lx,
where the object library libx.so contains WSMPLIB.  For instance if WSMP
is contained in the object library libwsmp.so, WSMPLIB should be set to
"-lwsmp". If the library is in a "non-standard place", WSMPLIB should
also point to the full path to the library. For example, if libwsmp.so
is in the directory /mylibrary, WSMPLIB should be set to
"-L/mylibrary -lwsmp" If a compiled version of WSMP is unavailable,
WSMPLIB will be set to "-lgalahad_wsmp".
N.B. WSMP is only optionally required but may improve performance.
