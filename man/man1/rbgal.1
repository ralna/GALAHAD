.TH rbgal 1
.SH NAME
\fBrbgal\fR \- Read a Rutherford-Boeing sparse matrix data file and
run a GALAHAD package on the result
.SH USAGE
.B rbgal architecture package
[options]
.IR file[.rb]
or
file[.tar[.gz]],

where
.B architecture
is a string of the form machine.os.compiler
indicating the machine/operating system/compiler combination to be used and
.B package
indicates the package required.

The Rutherford-Boeing data may be presented either as a text file of the form
file.[rb] or as a (compressed) UNIX tar file file.[tar[.gz]] in the
current directory. If the name file presented has no suffix, files named
file, file.rb, file.tar.gz and file.tar will be examined in turn until
a suitable match is found.

The name
.B architecture
must match that of one of the files in the directory
$GALAHAD/bin/sys , while
.B package
may be one of
.LP
.TP 1i
.BI sls
SLS for real symmetric matrices
.TP 1i
.BI uls
ULS for real unsymmetric matrices (interface forthcoming)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B rbgal
reads a user-defined Rutherford-Boeing problem-data file, and runs one of the
GALAHAD large-scale linear-equation solver packages on the result.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.TP 1i
.BI \-s
Run the single precision version of the package. The default is
to run the double precision version.
.TP
.B \-h or \-\-help
Print a list of these options and stop execution.
.TP
.BI \-u
Update the option specification file to incorporate the latest options.
The default is to leave the file alone (and create it if it does not exist).
.TP
.B \-k
Keep the executable after use. A second file newfile.rb may then be
processed by issuing the command
.ce 2

.B ./architecture.package < \fR newfile[.rb] .
.ce 0

.TP
.B \-m
Check for memory leaks (if possible).
.TP
.B \-p
Profile the code (if possible).
.TP
.BI \-o " output"
Specify the
.IR output
level, which must be one of
.B 0
(no output; the default)
.B 1
(a brief description of the steps performed)
.B -1
(a full debugging output, for experts only).
.TP
.BI \-l " secs"
Set a limit of
.IR secs
seconds on the GALAHAD run. The default is 99999999 seconds.
.SH FILES
.TP 20
.BI achitecture.package
executable output file created by rbgal
.TP
.IB RUN package .SPC
user-supplied option specification file
.TP
.IB SOLUTION.d
file containing solution created by rbgal
.TP
.IB SUMMARY.d
file containing summary of solution created by rbgal
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics produced by rbgal itself are intended to be self-explanatory.
