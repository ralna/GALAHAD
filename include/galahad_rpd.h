  in the following order:

  - \link rpd_initialize \endlink - provide default control parameters and
      set up initial data structures
  - \link rpd_get_stats \endlink - read a given QPLIB file into internal
     data structures, and report vital statistics
  - (optionally, and in any order, where relevant)
     - \link rpd_get_g \endlink - get the objective gradient term \f$g\f$
     - \link rpd_get_f \endlink - get the objective constant term \f$f\f$

  \subsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse unsymmetric co-ordinate storage format

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ constraint matrix \f$A\f$ will be
  output in sparse co-ordinate format.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse symmetric co-ordinate storage format

  Likewise, the symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ objective Hessian matrix
  \f$H\f$ will be returned in a sparse co-ordinate format. But crucially
  symmetry is exploited by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$H\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$h_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays H_row and
  H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as H_ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsection joint_symmetric_matrix_coordinate Joint sparse symmetric co-ordinate storage format

  The symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ constraint Hessian matrices
  \f$ (H_c)_i\f$ are stored as a whole in a joint symmetric co-ordinate
  storage format.
  In addition to the row and column indices and values of each lower
  triangular matrix, record is also kept of the particular constraint invlved.

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$H\f$,
  its constraint index k, row index i, column index j
  and value \f$(h_k)_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays H_c_ptr, H_c_row and
  H_c_col and real array H_c_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as H_c_ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note as before that only the entries in the lower triangles should be stored.

 @param[in] qplib_file is a one-dimensional array of type char that

 @param[in] qplib_file_len is a scalar variable of type int, that gives

 @param[out] status is a scalar variable of type int, that gives
    the exit status from the package. Possible values are:
  \li  0. The statistics have been recovered succesfully.
  \li -1. An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the
       offending array is written on unit control.error, and the
       returned allocation status and a string containing the name
       of the offending array are held in inform.alloc_status and
       inform.bad_alloc respectively.
  \li -2. A deallocation error occurred.  A message indicating the
       offending array is written on unit control.error and the
       returned allocation status and a string containing the
       name of the offending array are held in
       inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.

 @param[out] p_type is a one-dimensional array of size 4 and type char that
  specifies the type of quadratic programming problem encoded in the
  QPLIB file.\n\n
The first character indicates the type of objective function used.
   It will be one of the following:
   <ul>
      <li> L a linear objective function.
      <li> D a convex quadratic objective function whose Hessian is a
              diagonal matrix.
      <li> C a convex quadratic objective function.
      <li> Q a quadratic objective function whose Hessian may be indefinite.
   </ul>
   \n
The second character indicates the types of variables that are present.
     It will be one of the following:
   <ul>
      <li> C  all the variables are continuous.
      <li> B  all the variables are binary (0-1).
      <li> M  the variables are a mix of continuous and binary.
      <li> I  all the variables are integer.
      <li> G  the variables are a mix of continuous, binary and integer.
   </ul>
   \n
The third character indicates the type of the (most extreme)
     constraint function used; other constraints may be of a lesser type.
     It will be one of the following:
   <ul>
       <li> N  there are no constraints.
       <li> B  some of the variables lie between lower and upper bounds
              (box constraint).
       <li> L  the constraint functions are linear.
       <li> D  the constraint functions are convex quadratics with diagonal
              Hessians.
       <li> C  the constraint functions are convex quadratics.
       <li> Q  the constraint functions are quadratics whose Hessians
              may be indefinite.
   </ul>
     Thus for continuous problems, we would have
   <ul>
       <li> LCL            a linear program.
       <li> LCC or LCQ     a linear program with quadratic constraints.
       <li> CCB or QCB     a bound-constrained quadratic program.
       <li> CCL or QCL     a quadratic program.
       <li> CCC or CCQ or QCC or QCQ a quadratic program with quadratic
                          constraints.
   </ul>
     For integer problems, the second character would be I rather than C,
     and for mixed integer problems, the second character would by M or G.
