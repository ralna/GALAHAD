  \section sils_intro Introduction

  \subsection sils_purpose Purpose

  This package <b>solves sparse symmetric system of linear equations.</b>.
  Given an \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ sparse matrix \f$A = {a_{ij}}\f$, and an
  \f$n\f$ vector \f$b\f$, the package solves the system \f$A x = b\f$.
  The matrix \f$A\f$ need not be definite. There is an option for iterative
  refinement.

  Currently, only the control and inform parameters are exposed;
  these are provided and used by other GALAHAD packages with C interfaces.
  Extended functionality is available using the GALAHAD package sls.

  \subsection sils_date Originally released

  April 2001, C interface December 2021.

  \subsection sils_method Method

  The method used is a direct method based on a sparse variant
  of Gaussian elimination and is discussed further by

  I. S. Duff and J. K. Reid (1983),
  ACM Trans. Math. Software <b>9</b> pp.302-325.

  \subsection main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  The symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ coefficient matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.  Crucially symmetry
  is exploited  by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$A\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$A_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays row and
  col and real array val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array col, and real array val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.
