  \section bsc_intro Introduction

  \subsection bsc_purpose Purpose

  Given matrices \f$A\f$ and (diagonal) \f$D\f$, <b>build the
  "Schur complement"
  \f$S  =  A D A^T\f$</b> in sparse co-ordinate (and optionally sparse column)
  format(s). Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix
  \f$A\f$.

  Currently, only the control and inform parameters are exposed;
  these are provided and used by other GALAHAD packages with C interfaces.

  \subsection bsc_authors Authors

  N. I. M. Gould, STFC-Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, England.

  C interface, additionally J. Fowkes, STFC-Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.

  Julia interface, additionally A. Montoison and D. Orban, Polytechnique Montr√©al.

  \subsection bsc_date Originally released

  October 2013, C interface January 2022.

 \subsection bsc_call_order Call order

  To solve a given problem, functions from the bsc package must be called
  in the following order:

  - \link bsc_initialize \endlink - provide default control parameters and
      set up initial data structures
  - \link bsc_read_specfile \endlink (optional) - override control values
      by reading replacement values from a file
  - \link bsc_import \endlink - set up matrix data structures for \f$A\f$.
  - \link bsc_reset_control \endlink (optional) - possibly change control
      parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved
  - \link bsc_form \endlink - form the Schur complement \f$S\f$
  - \link bsc_information \endlink (optional) - recover information about
    the process
  - \link bsc_terminate \endlink - deallocate data structures

  \section main_topics Further topics

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  An unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented and
  stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense by columns storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by columns, that is,
  the values of the entries of each column in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$m \ast j + i\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_column_wise Sparse column-wise storage format

  Once again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in column j appear directly before those
  in column j+1. For the j-th column of \f$A\f$ the j-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this column,
  while A_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries.
  The row indices i, \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$, and values \f$A_{ij}\f$
  of the  nonzero entries in the j-th columnsare stored in components
  l = A_ptr(j), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(j+1)-1, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_row, and real array A_val, respectively.
  As before, for sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less
  storage than the co-ordinate format.
