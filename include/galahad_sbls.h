  \section sbls_intro Introduction

  \subsection sbls_purpose Purpose

  Given a <b>block, symmetric matrix</b>
  \f[K_H = \mat{cc}{ H & A^T \\ A & - C },\f]
\manonly
  \n
  K_H = ( H  A^T )
        ( A  - C )
  \n
\endmanonly
  this package constructs a variety of <b>preconditioners</b> of the form
  \f[K_{G} = \mat{cc}{ G & A^T \\ A & - C }.\f]
\manonly
  \n
  K_G = ( G  A^T ).
        ( A  - C )
  \n
\endmanonly
  Here, the leading-block matrix \f$G\f$ is a suitably-chosen
  approximation to \f$H\f$; it may either be prescribed <b>explicitly</b>, in
  which case a symmetric indefinite factorization of \f$K_G\f$
  will be formed using the GALAHAD symmetric matrix factorization package SLS,
  or <b>implicitly</b>, by requiring certain sub-blocks of \f$G\f$
  be zero. In the latter case, a factorization of \f$K_G\f$ will be
  obtained implicitly (and more efficiently) without recourse to SLS.
  In particular, for implicit preconditioners, a reordering
  \f[K_G = P
  \mat{ccc}{ G_{11}^{} & G_{21}^T & A_1^T \\  G_{21}^{} & G_{22}^{} & A_2^T \\
  A_{1}^{} & A_{2}^{} & - C} P^T
  \f]
\manonly
  \n
          ( G_11  G_21^T  A_1^T )
  K_G = P ( G_21   G_22   A_2^T ) P^T
          (  A_1   A_2     - C  )
  \n
\endmanonly
  involving a suitable permutation \f$P\f$ will be found, for some
  invertible sub-block (``basis'') \f$A_1\f$ of the columns of \f$A\f$;
  the selection and factorization of \f$A_1\f$ uses
  the GALAHAD unsymmetric matrix factorization package ULS.
  Once the preconditioner has been constructed,
  solutions to the preconditioning system
  \f[\mat{cc}{ G & A^T \\ A  & - C } \vect{ x \\ y }
   = \vect{a \\ b}
  \f]
\manonly
\n
  ( G  A^T ) ( x ) = ( a )
  ( A  - C ) ( y )   ( b )
\n
\endmanonly
may be obtained by the package.
  Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrices \f$H\f$,
  \f$A\f$ and \f$C\f$.

  \subsection sbls_method Method

  The method used depends on whether an explicit or implicit
  factorization is required. In the explicit case, the
  package is really little more than a wrapper for the GALAHAD
  symmetric, indefinite linear solver SLS in
  which the system matrix \f$K_G\f$ is assembled from its constituents
  \f$A\f$, \f$C\f$ and whichever \f$G\f$ is requested by the user.
  Implicit-factorization preconditioners are more involved,
  and there is a large variety of different possibilities. The
  essential ideas are described in detail in

  H. S. Dollar, N. I. M. Gould and A. J. Wathen.
  ``On implicit-factorization constraint preconditioners''.
  In Large Scale Nonlinear Optimization (G. Di Pillo and M. Roma, eds.)
  Springer Series on Nonconvex Optimization and Its Applications, Vol. 83,
  Springer Verlag (2006) 61--82

  and

  H. S. Dollar, N. I. M. Gould, W. H. A. Schilders and A. J. Wathen
  ``On iterative methods and implicit-factorization preconditioners for
  regularized saddle-point systems''.
  SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 28(1) (2006) 170--189.

  The range-space factorization is based upon the decomposition
  \f[K_{G} = \mat{cc}{ G & 0 \\ A & I}
  \mat{cc}{ G^{-1} & 0 \\ 0 & - S}  \mat{cc}{ G & A^T \\ 0 & I},
  \f]
\manonly
  \n
  K_G = ( G  0 ) ( G^{-1} 0 ) ( G A^T )
        ( A  I ) (   0   -S ) ( 0  I  )
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the ``Schur complement'' \f$S = C + A G^{-1} A^T\f$.
  Such a method requires that \f$S\f$ is easily invertible. This is often the
  case when \f$G\f$ is a diagonal matrix, in which case \f$S\f$ is frequently
  sparse, or when \f$m \ll n\f$ in which case \f$S\f$
  is small and a dense Cholesky factorization may be used.

  When \f$C = 0\f$, the null-space factorization is based upon the decomposition
  \f[K_{G} = P  \mat{ccc}{  G_{11}^{} & 0 & I \\
  G_{21}^{} & I & A_{2}^{T} A_{1}^{-T} \\  A_{1}^{} & 0 & 0 }
  \mat{ccc}{0 & 0 & I \\ \;\;\; 0 \;\; & \;\; R \;\; & 0 \\ I & 0 & - G_{11}^{}}
  \mat{ccc}{  G_{11}^{} & G_{21}^T & A_{1}^T \\  0 & I & 0 \\
  I & A_{1}^{-1} A_{2}^{} & 0} P^T,
  \f]
\manonly
  \n
          ( G_11  0      I          ) ( 0  0   I   )
  K_G = P ( G_21  I  A_2^T A_1^{-T} ) ( 0  R   0   )
          ( A_1   0      0          ) ( I  0 -G_11 )

            ( G_11   G_21^T   A_1^T )
          . (  0        I        0  ) P^T,
            (  I    A_1^{-1} A_2  0 )
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the ``reduced Hessian''
  \f[R = ( - A_{2}^{T} A_1^{-T} \;\; I )
  \mat{cc}{G_{11}^{} & G_{21}^{T} \\ G_{21}^{} & G_{22}^{}}
  \vect{ - A_1^{-1} A_2^{} \\ I}
  \f]
\manonly
  \n
   R = ( -A_2^T A_1^{-T}  I )( G_11  G_21^T ) ( -A_1^{-1} A_2 )
                             ( G_21   G_22  ) (       I       )
  \n
\endmanonly
  and \f$P\f$ is a suitably-chosen permutation for which \f$A_1\f$ is
  invertible. The method is most useful when \f$m \approx n\f$ as then the
  dimension of \f$R\f$ is small and a dense Cholesky factorization may be used.

  \subsection sbls_call_order Call order

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ constraint matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsection main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  Likewise, the symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ matrix \f$H\f$, as well as
  the \f$m\f$ by \f$m\f$ matrix \f$C\f$,  may be presented
  and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry is exploited
  by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal). We focus
  on \f$H\f$, but everything we say applies equally to \f$C\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$H\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$H\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array H_val
  will hold the value \f$h_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$h_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$H\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$h_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays H_row and
  H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as H_ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$H\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = H_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_diagonal Diagonal storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is diagonal (i.e., \f$H_{ij} = 0\f$ for all
  \f$0 \leq i \neq j \leq n-1\f$) only the diagonals entries
  \f$H_{ii}\f$, \f$0 \leq i \leq n-1\f$ need
  be stored, and the first n components of the array H_val may be
  used for the purpose.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_scaled_identity Multiples of the identity storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is a multiple of the identity matrix, (i.e., \f$H = \alpha I\f$
  where \f$I\f$ is the n by n identity matrix and \f$\alpha\f$ is a scalar),
  it suffices to store \f$\alpha\f$ as the first component of H_val.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_identity The identity matrix format

  If \f$H\f$ is the identity matrix, no values need be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_zero The zero matrix format

  The same is true if \f$H\f$ is the zero matrix.
