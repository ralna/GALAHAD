  \subsection cro_purpose Purpose

  Provides a <b>crossover</b> from a solution
  to the <b>convex quadratic programming problem</b>
  \f[\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T H x + g^T x + f \f]
\manonly
  \n
  minimize q(x) := 1/2 x^T H x + g^T x + f
  \n
\endmanonly
  subject to the general linear constraints
  \f[c_i^l  \leq  a_i^Tx  \leq c_i^u, \;\;\; i = 1, \ldots , m,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   c_i^l \[<=] a_i^Tx \[<=] c_i^u, i = 1, ... , m,
  \n
\endmanonly
  and the simple bound constraints
  \f[x_j^l  \leq  x_j \leq x_j^u, \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   x_j^l \[<=] x_j \[<=] x_j^u, j = 1, ... , n,
  \n
\endmanonly
  found by an interior-point method to one in which the
  <b>matrix of defining active constraints/variables is of full rank.</b>
  Here, the \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ symmetric, positive-semi-definite matrix
  \f$H\f$, the vectors \f$g\f$, \f$a_i\f$, \f$c^l\f$, \f$c^u\f$, \f$x^l\f$,
  \f$x^u\f$, the scalar \f$f\f$ are given. In addition a solution \f$x\f$ along
  with optimal Lagrange multipliers \f$y\f$ for the general constraints
  and dual variables \f$z\f$ for the simple bounds must be provided
  (see Section~\ref{galmethod}).   These will be adjusted as necessary.
  Any of the constraint bounds \f$c_i^l\f$, \f$c_i^u\f$, \f$x_j^l\f$
  and \f$x_j^u\f$ may be infinite.
  Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix \f$H\f$
  or the matrix \f$A\f$ of vectors \f$a_i\f$.

   z^l \geq 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\; z^u \leq 0,\hspace{24mm}$} \f]
\manonly
  \n
   (2b) y = y^l + y^u, z = z^l + z^u, y^l \[>=] 0, y^u \[<=] 0,
        z^l \[>=] 0 and z^u \[<=] 0,

  and the complementary slackness conditions

  (3) (A x - c^l)^T y^l = 0, (A x - c^u)^T y^u = 0,
      (x -x^l)^T z^l = 0 and (x -x^u)^T z^u = 0,
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the vectors \f$y\f$ and \f$z\f$ are known as the Lagrange multipliers
  for the general linear constraints, and the dual variables for the bounds,
  respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold component-wise.

  \subsection cro_method Method

  Denote the active constraints by \f$A_A x = c_A\f$ and the active bounds by
  \f$I_A x = x_A\f$. Then any optimal solution satisfies the linear system
  \f[\left(\begin{array}{ccc}H & - A_A^T & - I^T_A \\ A_A & 0 & 0 \\ I_A & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{c}x \\ y_A \\ z_A\end{array}\right) =
\left(\begin{array}{c}- g \\ c_A \\ x_A\end{array}\right).\f]
\manonly
  \n
       ( H   - A_A^T - I_A^T ) (  x  )   ( - g )
       ( A_A     0       0   ) ( y_A ) = ( c_A ),
       ( I_A     0       0   ) ( z_A )   ( x_A )
  \n
\endmanonly
  where \f$y_A\f$ and \f$z_A\f$ are the corresponding active Lagrange
  multipliers and dual variables respectively. Consequently the difference
  between any two solutions \f$(\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z)\f$ must satisfy
  \f[\mbox{(4)}\;\; \left(\begin{array}{ccc}H & - A_A^T & - I^T_A \\ A_A & 0 & 0 \\ I_A & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{c}\Delta x \\ \Delta y_A \\ \Delta z_A\end{array}\right) = 0.\f]
\manonly
  \n
          ( H   - A_A^T - I_A^T ) (  Delta x  )
    (4)   ( A_A     0       0   ) ( Delta y_A ) = 0,
          ( I_A     0       0   ) ( Delta z_A )
  \n
\endmanonly
  Thus there can only be multiple solution if the coefficient matrix \f$K\f$
  of (4) is singular. The algorithm used in CRO
  exploits this. The matrix \f$K\f$ is checked for singularity
  using the GALAHAD package ULS. If \f$K\f$ is
  non singular, the solution is unique and the solution input by the user
  provides a linearly independent active set. Otherwise \f$K\f$ is singular,
  and partitions \f$A_A^T = ( A_B^T \;\; A_N^T)\f$ and
  \f$I_A^T = ( I_B^T \;\; I_N^T)\f$ are found so that
  \f[\left(\begin{array}{ccc}H & - A_B^T & - I_B^T \\ A_B & 0 & 0 \\ I_B & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right)\f]
\manonly
  \n
       ( H   - A_B^T - I_B^T )
       ( A_B     0       0   )
       ( I_B     0       0   )
  \n
\endmanonly
  is non-singular and the <b>non-basic</b> constraints \f$A_N^T\f$
  and \f$I_N^T\f$ are linearly dependent on the <b>basic</b> ones
  \f$( A_B^T \;\; I_B^T)\f$. In this case (4) is equivalent to
  \f[\mbox{(5)}\;\; \left(\begin{array}{ccc}H & - A_B^T & - I_B^T \\ A_B & 0 & 0 \\ I_B & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c}A_N^T \\ 0 \\ 0\end{array}\right) \Delta y_N + \left(\begin{array}{c}I_N^T \\ 0 \\ 0\end{array}\right) \Delta z_N\f]
\manonly
  \n
          ( H   - A_B^T - I_B^T ) (  Delta x  )
  (5)     ( A_B     0       0   ) ( Delta y_A ) =
          ( I_B     0       0   ) ( Delta z_A )

            ( A_N^T )             ( I_N^T )
            (   0   ) Delta y_N + (   0   ) Delta z_N.
            (   0   )             (   0   )
  \n
\endmanonly
  Thus, starting from the user's \f$(x, y, z)\f$
  and with a factorization of the coefficient matrix of (5)
  found by the GALAHAD package SLS, the alternative solution
  \f$(x + \alpha x, y + \alpha y, z + \alpha z)\f$,
  featuring
  \f$(\Delta x, \Delta y_B, \Delta z_B)\f$
  from (5)  in which successively one of the components of \f$\Delta y_N\f$
  and \f$\Delta z_N\f$ in turn is non zero, is taken.
  The scalar \f$\alpha\f$ at each stage
  is chosen to be the largest possible that guarantees (2.b);
  this may happen when a non-basic multiplier/dual variable reaches zero,
  in which case the corresponding constraint is disregarded, or when this
  happens for a basic multiplier/dual variable, in which case this constraint is
  exchanged with the non-basic one under consideration and disregarded.
  The latter corresponds to changing the basic-non-basic partition
  in (5), and subsequent solutions may be found by updating
  the factorization of the coefficient matrix in (5)
  following the basic-non-basic swap using the GALAHAD package SCU.

  \subsection cro_call_order Call order

  To solve a given problem, functions from the cro package must be called
  in the following order:

  - \link cro_initialize \endlink - provide default control parameters and
      set up initial data structures
  - \link cro_read_specfile \endlink (optional) - override control values
      by reading replacement values from a file
  - \link cro_crossover_solution \endlink - move from a primal-dual soution
      to a full rank one
  - \link cro_terminate \endlink - deallocate data structures

  \subsection fdc_array_indexing Array indexing

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; add 1 to input integer arrays if fortran-style indexing is
  used, and beware that return integer arrays will adhere to this.

    The i-th component of c_u, i = 0, ... ,  m-1, contains  \f$c^u_i\f$.

 @param[in] x_l is a one-dimensional array of size n and type double, that
    holds the lower bounds \f$x^l\f$ on the variables \f$x\f$.
    The j-th component of x_l, j = 0, ... ,  n-1, contains  \f$x^l_j\f$.

 @param[in] x_u is a one-dimensional array of size n and type double, that
    holds the upper bounds \f$x^l\f$ on the variables \f$x\f$.
    The j-th component of x_u, j = 0, ... ,  n-1, contains  \f$x^l_j\f$.

 @param[in,out] x is a one-dimensional array of size n and type double, that
    holds the values \f$x\f$ of the optimization variables. The j-th component
    of x, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains \f$x_j\f$.

 @param[in,out] c is a one-dimensional array of size m and type double, that
    holds the residual \f$c(x) = A x\f$.
    The i-th component of c, j = 0, ... ,  n-1, contains  \f$c_j(x) \f$.

 @param[in,out] y is a one-dimensional array of size n and type double, that
    holds the values \f$y\f$ of the Lagrange multipliers for the general
    linear constraints. The j-th component
    of y, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains \f$y_j\f$.

 @param[in,out] z is a one-dimensional array of size n and type double, that
    holds the values \f$z\f$ of the dual variables.
    The j-th component of z, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains \f$z_j\f$.

 @param[in,out] x_stat is a one-dimensional array of size n and type int, that
    must be set on entry to give the status of the problem variables.
    If x_stat(j) is negative, the variable \f$x_j\f$ is active on its lower
    bound, if it is  positive, it is active and lies on its upper bound, and
    if it is zero, it is inactiive and lies between its bounds. On exit, the
    \f$j\f$-th component of x_stat is -1 if the variable is basic and active on
    its lower bound, -2 it is non-basic but active on its lower bound, 1 if it
    is basic and active on its upper bound, 2 it is non-basic but active on its
    upper bound, and 0 if it is inactive.

 @param[in,out] c_stat is a one-dimensional array of size m and type int, that
    must be set on entry to give the status of the general linear constraints.
    If c_stat(i) is negative, the constraint value \f$a_i^Tx\f$ is active on its
    lower  bound, if it is positive, it is active and lies on its upper bound,
    and if it is zero, it is inactiive and lies between its bounds. On exit,
    the \f$i\f$-th component of x_stat is -1 if the constraint is basic and
    active on its lower bound, -2 it is non-basic but active on its lower
    bound, 1 if it is basic and active on its upper bound, 2 it is non-basic
    but active on its upper bound, and 0 if it is inactive.
