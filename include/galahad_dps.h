  \section dps_intro Introduction

  \subsection dps_purpose Purpose

  Given a real \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ symmetric matrix \f$H\f$, this package
  <b>construct a
  symmetric, positive definite matrix \f$M\f$ so that \f$H\f$
  is diagonal in the norm \f$\|v\|_{M} = \sqrt{v^T M v}\f$
  induced by \f$M\f$</b>. Subsequently the package can be use to
  <b>solve the trust-region subproblem</b>
  \f[\mbox{(1)}\;\; \mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T H x + c^T x
    + f \;\; \mbox{subject to}\;\; \|x\||_{M} \leq \Delta\f]
  or the <b>regularized quadratic problem</b>
  \f[\mbox{(2)}\;\;\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) + \frac{1}{p} \sigma \|x\||_{M}^p\hspace{50mm} \mbox{$$}\f]
  for a real \f$n\f$ vector \f$c\f$ and scalars \f$f\f$,
  \f$\Delta>0\f$, \f$\sigma>0\f$ and \f$p \geq 2\f$.

  A factorization of the matrix \f$H\f$ will be required, so this package is
  most suited for the case where such a factorization, either dense or sparse,
  may be found efficiently.

  \subsection dps_terminology Terminology

  \subsection dps_method Method

  The required solution \f$x_*\f$ necessarily satisfies the optimality
  condition \f$H x_* + \lambda_* M x_* + c = 0\f$,
  where \f$\lambda_* \geq 0\f$ is a Lagrange
  multiplier that corresponds to the constraint
  \f$\|x\|_{M}  \leq  \Delta\f$ in the trust-region case (1),
  and is given by \f$\lambda_* = \sigma \|x_*\|^{p-2}\f$
  for the regularization problem (2).
  In addition \f$H + \lambda_* M\f$ will be positive semi-definite; in
  most instances it will actually be positive definite, but in special
  ``hard'' cases singularity is a possibility.

  The matrix \f$H\f$ is decomposed as
  \f[H = P L D L^T P^T\f]
  by calling the GALAHAD package \c SLS.
  Here \f$P\f$ is a permutation matrix,
  \f$L\f$ is unit lower triangular and \f$D\f$ is block diagonal, with
  blocks of dimension at most two. The spectral decomposition of each diagonal
  block of \f$D\f$ is computed, and each eigenvalue \f$\theta\f$ is replaced by
  \f$\max ( | \theta | , \theta_{\min} ) \f$,
  where \f$\theta_{\min}\f$ is a positive user-supplied value. The resulting
  block diagonal matrix is \f$B\f$, from which we define the
  <b>modified-absolute-value</b>
  \f[M = P L B L^T P^T;\f]
  an alternative due to Goldfarb uses instead the simpler
  \f[M = P L L^T P^T.\f]

  Given the factors of \f$H\f$ (and \f$M\f$), the required solution is
  found by making the change of variables \f$y = B^{1/2} L^T P^T x\f$
  (or \f$y = L^T P^T x\f$ in the Goldfarb case)
  which results in ``diagonal'' trust-region and regularization subproblems,
  whose solution may be easily obtained suing a Newton or higher-order iteration
  of a resulting ``secular'' equation.  If subsequent problems, for which
  \f$H\f$ and \f$c\f$ are unchanged, are to be attempted, the existing
  factorization and solution may easily be exploited.

  The dominant cost is that for the factorization of the symmetric, but
  potentially indefinite, matrix \f$H\f$ using the GALAHAD package \c SLS.

  \subsection dps_references Reference

  The method is described in detail for the trust-region case in

  N. I. M. Gould and J. Nocedal (1998).

  In ``High Performance Algorithms and Software in Nonlinear Optimization''
  (R. De Leone, A. Murli, P. M. Pardalos and G. Toraldo, eds.),
  Kluwer Academic Publishers, pp. 225-241,

  while the adaptation for the regularization case is obvious. The method used
  to solve the diagonal trust-region and regularization subproblems are as
  given by

      by reading replacement values from a file

      parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved

    - \link dps_solve_rq_problem \endlink - solve the regularized-quadratic
        problem (2)

        (1) when the non-matrix data has changed
    - \link dps_resolve_rq_problem \endlink - resolve the regularized-quadratic
        problem (2) when the non-matrix data has changed

  \subsection main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  The symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ coefficient matrix \f$H\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.  Crucially symmetry
  is exploited  by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$H\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$H\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$H_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array val
  will hold the value \f$H_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$H_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$H\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$H_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays row and
  col and real array val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$H\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$H_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array col, and real array val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.
