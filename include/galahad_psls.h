  \section psls_intro Introduction

  \subsection psls_purpose Purpose

  Given an \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$  sparse symmetric matrix \f$A =a_{ij}\f$,
  this package <b>builds a suitable symmetric, positive definite (or
  diagonally dominant)-preconditioner \f$P\f$ of \f$A\f$ or a symmetric
  sub-matrix thereof</b>. The matrix \f$A\f$ need not be definite. Facilities
  are provided to apply the preconditioner to a given vector, and to
  remove rows and columns (symmetrically) from the initial
  preconditioner without a full re-factorization.

  Note that <b> the solvers themselves do not form part of this package and
  must be obtained separately.</b>
  Dummy instances are provided for solvers that are unavailable.

  Orderings to reduce the bandwidth, as implemented in HSL's MC61, are due to

  J. K. Reid and J. A. Scott (1999)
  Ordering symmetric sparse matrices for small profile and wavefront
  International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering
  <b>45</b> 1737-1755.

  If a subset of the rows and columns are specified, the remaining rows/columns
  are removed before processing. Any subsequent removal of rows and columns
  is achieved using the GALAHAD Schur-complement updating package SCU
  unless a complete re-factorization is likely more efficient.

  \subsection psls_call_order Call order

  To solve a given problem, functions from the psls package must be called
  in the following order:

  - \link psls_initialize \endlink - provide default control parameters and
      set up initial data structures
  - \link psls_read_specfile \endlink (optional) - override control values
      by reading replacement values from a file
  - \link psls_import \endlink - set up matrix data structures for \f$A\f$
      prior to solution
  - \link psls_reset_control \endlink (optional) - possibly change control
      parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved
  - one of
    - \link psls_form_preconditioner \endlink - form and factorize a
      preconditioner \f$P\f$ of the matrix \f$A\f$
    - \link psls_form_subset_preconditioner \endlink - form and factorize a
      preconditioner \f$P\f$ of a symmetric submatrix of the matrix \f$A\f$
  - \link psls_update_preconditioner \endlink (optional) - update the
       preconditioner \f$P\f$ when rows (amd columns) are removed
  - \link psls_apply_preconditioner \endlink - solve the linear system of
        equations \f$Px=b\f$
  - \link psls_information \endlink (optional) - recover information about
    the preconditioner and solution process
  - \link psls_terminate \endlink - deallocate data structures

 \subsection main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  The symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ coefficient matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.  Crucially symmetry
  is exploited  by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$A\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$A_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays row and
  col and real array val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array col, and real array val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

       returned allocation status and a string containing the

  \li -3. The restriction n > 0 or requirement that type contains
       its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate', 'sparse_by_rows' or

 @param[in] n is a scalar variable of type int, that holds the number of

 @param[in] type is a one-dimensional array of type char that specifies the

   'sparse_by_rows' or 'dense'; lower or upper case variants are allowed.

 @param[in] ne is a scalar variable of type int, that holds the number of
   entries in the lower triangular part of \f$A\f$ in the sparse co-ordinate
   storage scheme. It need not be set for any of the other schemes.

 @param[in] row is a one-dimensional array of size ne and type int, that
   holds the row indices of the lower triangular part of \f$A\f$ in the sparse
   co-ordinate storage scheme. It need not be set for any of the other
   three schemes, and in this case can be NULL.

 @param[in] col is a one-dimensional array of size ne and type int,
   that holds the column indices of the lower triangular part of \f$A\f$ in
   either the sparse co-ordinate, or the sparse row-wise storage scheme. It
