  \section hash_intro Introduction

  \subsection hash_purpose Purpose

  Set up, insert into, remove from and search a chained scatter table
  (Williams, CACM 2, 21-24, 1959).

  Currently, only the control and inform parameters are exposed;
  these are provided and used by other GALAHAD packages with C interfaces.

  \subsection hash_authors Authors

  N. I. M. Gould, STFC-Rutherford Appleton Laboratory,
  England.

  C interface, additionally J. Fowkes, STFC-Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.

  Julia interface, additionally A. Montoison and D. Orban, Polytechnique Montr√©al.

  \subsection hash_date Originally released

  December 1990, C interface January 2022.
