  \section lsrt_intro Introduction

  \subsection lsrt_purpose Purpose

  Given a real \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ matrix \f$A\f$, a real \f$m\f$ vector \f$b\f$ and
  scalars \f$\sigma>0\f$ and \f$p \geq 2\f$, this package finds an
  <b>approximate minimizer of the regularised linear-least-squares
  objective function
  \f$\frac{1}{2}\| A x - b\|_2^2 + \frac{1}{p} \sigma \| x \|_2^p\f$.
  </b>
  This problem commonly occurs as a subproblem in nonlinear
  optimization calculations involving cubic regularisation,
  and may be used to regularise the solution
  of under-determined or ill-conditioned linear least-squares problems.
  The method may be suitable for large \f$m\f$ and/or \f$n\f$ as no factorization
  involving \f$A\f$ is required. Reverse communication is used to obtain
  matrix-vector products of the form \f$u + A v\f$ and
  \f$v + A^T u\f$.

  \subsection lsrt_terminology Terminology

  The required solution \f$x\f$ necessarily satisfies the optimality condition
  \f$A^T ( A x - b ) + \lambda x = 0\f$, where the multiplier
  \f$\lambda = \sigma \|x\|_2^{p-2}\f$.

  \subsection lsrt_method Method

  The method is iterative. Starting  with the vector \f$u_1 = b\f$, a
  bi-diagonalisation process is used to generate the vectors \f$v_k\f$ and
  \f$u_k+1\f$ so that the \f$n\f$ by \f$k\f$ matrix
  \f$V_k = ( v_1 \ldots v_k)\f$
  and the \f$m\f$ by \f$(k+1)\f$ matrix \f$U_k = ( u_1 \ldots u_{k+1})\f$
  together satisfy
  \f[A V_k = U_{k+1} B_k \;\mbox{and}\; b = \|b\|_2 U_{k+1} e_1\f]
\manonly
\n
\n
\endmanonly
  where \f$B_k\f$ is \f$(k+1)\f$ by \f$k\f$ and lower bi-diagonal,
  \f$U_k\f$ and  \f$V_k\f$ have orthonormal columns
  and \f$e_1\f$ is the first unit vector.  The solution sought is of the
  form \f$x_k = V_k y_k\f$, where \f$y_k\f$
  solves the bi-diagonal regularised least-squares problem
  \f[(1) \;\;\; \min \| B_k y - \|b\| e_1 \|_2 + \frac{1}{p} \sigma \|  y \|_2^p.\f]
\manonly
\n
   (1) min || B_k y - ||b|| e_1 ||_2  + 1/p sigma || y||^p_2.
\n
\endmanonly
  To minimize (1), the optimality conditions
  \f[( B_k^T ( B_k^{} y(\lambda) - \|b\| e_1^{} ) + \lambda y(\lambda) = 0,\f]
\manonly
\n
\n
\endmanonly
  where \f$\lambda = \sigma \|y(\lambda)\|_2^{p-2} \|\f$,
  are used as the basis of an iteration.
  The vector \f$y(\lambda)\f$ is equivalently the solution to the
  regularised least-squares problem
  \f[(2) \;\;\; \min  \left \| \vect{ B_k \\ \lambda^{\frac{1}{2}} I } y - \|b\| e_1^{} \right \|_2.\f]
\manonly
\n
    (2)    min  ||  B_k y - ||b|| e_1 ||
                ||    lambda^{1/2} y  ||
\n
\endmanonly
  Thus, given an estimate \f$\lambda \geq 0\f$, (2) may be efficiently
  solved to give \f$y(\lambda)\f$.
  It is then simply a matter of adjusting \f$\lambda\f$
  (for example by a Newton-like process) to solve the scalar nonlinear equation
  \f[(3) \;\;\; \theta(\lambda) \equiv\| y(\lambda) \|_2^{p-2} - \frac{\lambda}{\sigma} = 0.\f]
\manonly
\n
   (3)   theta(lambda) = || y(lambda) ||_2^{p-2} - lambda/sigma = 0.
\n
\endmanonly
  In practice (3) is reformulated, and a more rapidly converging
  iteration is used. Having found  \f$y_k\f$, a second pass in which
  \f$x_k = V_k y_k\f$ is regenerated is needed---this need only be done
  once \f$x_k\f$ has implicitly deemed to be sufficiently close to optimality.
  As this second pass is an additional expense, a record is kept of the
  optimal objective function values for each value of \f$k\f$, and the second
  pass is only performed so far as to ensure a given fraction of the
  final optimal objective value. Large savings may be made in the second
  pass by choosing the required fraction to be significantly smaller than one.

  Special code is used in the special case \f$p=2\f$, as in this case
  a single pass suffices.

  \subsection lsrt_call_order Call order

  To solve a given problem, functions from the lsrt package must be called
  in the following order:

  - \link lsrt_initialize \endlink - provide default control parameters and
      set up initial data structures
  - \link lsrt_read_specfile \endlink (optional) - override control values
      by reading replacement values from a file
  - \link lsrt_import_control \endlink - import control parameters prior to
      solution
  - \link lsrt_solve_problem \endlink - solve the problem by reverse
      communication, a sequence of calls are made under control of a status
      parameter, each exit either asks the user to provide additional
      informaton and to re-enter, or reports that either the solution has
      been found or that an error has occurred
  - \link lsrt_information \endlink (optional) - recover information about
    the solution and solution process
  - \link lsrt_terminate \endlink - deallocate data structures
