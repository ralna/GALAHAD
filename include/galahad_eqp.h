  \section eqp_intro Introduction

  \subsection eqp_purpose Purpose

  This package uses an iterative method to solve the
  <b>equality-constrained quadratic programming problem</b>
  \f[\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T H x + g^T x + f \f]
\manonly
  \n
  minimize q(x) := 1/2 x^T H x + g^T x + f
  \n
\endmanonly
  subject to the linear constraints
  \f[(1) \;\; A x + c = 0,\f]
  where the \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ symmetric matrix \f$H\f$,
  the \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ matrix \f$A\f$, the vectors \f$g\f$ and \f$c\f$
  Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrices \f$H\f$
  and \f$A\f$.

  The package may alternatively be used to minimize the (shifted) squared-
  least-distance objective
  \f[\frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^n w_j^2 ( x_j - x_j^0 )^2 + g^T x + f,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   minimize 1/2 \sum_{j=1}^n w_j^2 ( x_j - x_j^0 )^2  + g^T x + f,
  \n
\endmanonly
  subject to the linear constraint (1), for given vectors \f$w\f$ and
  \f$x^0\f$.

  \subsection eqp_terminology Terminology

  The required solution \f$x\f$ necessarily satisfies
  the primal optimality conditions
  \f[(2) \;\; A x + c = 0\f]
\manonly
  \n
  (2) A x + c = 0
  \n
\endmanonly
  and the dual optimality conditions
\latexonly
  \[  H x + g - A^T y = 0 \;\; (\mbox{or} \;\; W^{2} (x -x^0) + g - A^T y = 0 \;\;  \mbox{for the shifted-least-distance type objective})\]
\endlatexonly
\htmlonly
  $$H x + g - A^T y = 0 \;\; (\mbox{or} \;\;  W^{2} (x -x^0) + g - A^T y = 0 \;\; \mbox{for the shifted-least-distance type objective})$$
\endhtmlonly
\manonly
  \n
  (3) H x + g - A^T y = 0
       (or W^2 (x -x^0) + g - A^T y = 0
        for the shifted-least-distance type objective)
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the diagonal matrix \f$W^2\f$ has diagonal entries \f$w_j^2\f$,
  \f$j = 1, \ldots , n\f$, and where the vector \f$y\f$ is
  known as the Lagrange multipliers for the linear constraints.

 \subsection eqp_method Method

  A solution to the problem is found in two phases.
  In the first, a point \f$x_F\f$ satisfying (2) is found.
  In the second, the required solution \f$x = x_F + s\f$
  is determined by finding \f$s\f$ to minimize
  \f$q(s) = \frac{1}{2} s^T H s + g_F^T s + f_F\f$
  subject to the homogeneous constraints \f$A s = zero\f$,
  where \f$g_F = H x_F + g\f$ and
  \f$f_F = \frac{1}{2} x_F^T H x_F + g^T x_F + f\f$.
  The required constrained minimizer of \f$q(s)\f$ is obtained
  by implictly applying the preconditioned conjugate-gradient method
  in the null space of \f$A\f$. Any preconditioner of the form
  \f[ K_G = \mat{cc}{ G & A^T \\ A  & 0 }\f]
\manonly
  \n
  K_G = ( G  A^T )
        ( A   0  )
  \n
\endmanonly
  is suitable, and the GALAHAD package SBLS provides a number of
  possibilities. In order to ensure that the minimizer obtained is
  finite, an additional, precautionary trust-region constraint \f$\|s\|
  \leq \Delta\f$ for some suitable positive radius \f$\Delta\f$ is
  imposed, and the GALAHAD package GLTR is used to solve this
  additionally-constrained problem.

  \subsection eqp_call_order Call order

  To solve a given problem, functions from the eqp package must be called
  in the following order:

  - \link eqp_initialize \endlink - provide default control parameters and
      set up initial data structures
  - \link eqp_read_specfile \endlink (optional) - override control values
      by reading replacement values from a file
  - \link eqp_import \endlink - set up problem data structures and fixed
      values
  - \link eqp_reset_control \endlink (optional) - possibly change control
      parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved
  - solve the problem by calling one of
     - \link eqp_solve_qp \endlink - solve the quadratic program
     - \link eqp_solve_sldqp \endlink - solve the shifted least-distance problem
  - \link eqp_resolve_qp \endlink (optional) - resolve the problem with the
    same Hessian and Jacobian, but different \f$g\f$, \f$f\f$ and/or \f$c\f$
  - \link eqp_information \endlink (optional) - recover information about
    the solution and solution process
  - \link eqp_terminate \endlink - deallocate data structures

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ constraint matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsection main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  Likewise, the symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ objective Hessian matrix
  \f$H\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry is exploited
  by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$H\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$H\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array H_val
  will hold the value \f$h_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$h_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$H\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$h_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays H_row and
  H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as H_ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$H\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = H_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_diagonal Diagonal storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is diagonal (i.e., \f$H_{ij} = 0\f$ for all
  \f$0 \leq i \neq j \leq n-1\f$) only the diagonals entries
  \f$H_{ii}\f$, \f$0 \leq i \leq n-1\f$ need
  be stored, and the first n components of the array H_val may be
  used for the purpose.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_scaled_identity Multiples of the identity storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is a multiple of the identity matrix, (i.e., \f$H = \alpha I\f$
  where \f$I\f$ is the n by n identity matrix and \f$\alpha\f$ is a scalar),
  it suffices to store \f$\alpha\f$ as the first component of H_val.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_identity The identity matrix format

  If \f$H\f$ is the identity matrix, no values need be stored.
