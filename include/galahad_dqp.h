  \section dqp_intro Introduction

  \subsection dqp_purpose Purpose

  This package uses a dual gradient-projection interior-point method
  to solve the <b>strictly convex quadratic programming problem</b>
  \f[(0) \;\;\; \mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T H x + g^T x + f \f]
\manonly
  \n
  (0)   minimize q(x) := 1/2 x^T H x + g^T x + f
  \n
\endmanonly
  or the <b>shifted least-distance problem</b>
  \f[\mbox{minimize}\;\; \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^n w_j^2 ( x_j^{ } - x_j^0 )^2
   + g^T x + f \f]
\manonly
  \n
   minimize 1/2 \sum_{j=1}^n w_j^2 ( x_j - x_j^0 )^2  + g^T x + f
  \n
\endmanonly
  subject to the general linear constraints
  \f[c_i^l  \leq  a_i^Tx  \leq c_i^u, \;\;\; i = 1, \ldots , m,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   c_i^l \[<=] a_i^Tx \[<=] c_i^u, i = 1, ... , m,
  \n
\endmanonly
  and the simple bound constraints
  \f[x_j^l  \leq  x_j^{ } \leq x_j^u, \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   x_j^l \[<=] x_j \[<=] x_j^u, j = 1, ... , n,
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ symmetric, positive-definite matrix
  \f$H\f$, the vectors \f$g\f$, \f$w\f$, \f$x^0\f$,
  \f$a_i\f$, \f$c^l\f$, \f$c^u\f$, \f$x^l\f$,
  \f$x^u\f$ and the scalar \f$f\f$ are given.
  Any of the constraint bounds \f$c_i^l\f$, \f$c_i^u\f$,
  \f$x_j^l\f$ and \f$x_j^u\f$ may be infinite.
  Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix \f$H\f$
  or the matrix \f$A\f$ of vectors \f$a_i\f$.

  \subsection dqp_terminology Terminology

  The required solution \f$x\f$ necessarily satisfies
  the primal optimality conditions
  \f[\mbox{(1a) $\hspace{66mm} A x = c\hspace{66mm}$}\f]

  where

  \subsection dqp_method Method

  Dual gradient-projection methods solve (0) by instead solving the
  dual quadratic program
\latexonly
\[\mbox{(4) $\arr{ll}{\mbox{minimize}\;\; q^D(y^l, y^u, z^l, z^u) = & \!\!\! \frac{1}{2} [ ( y^l  + y^u )^T A + ( z^l + z^u ]^T ) H^{-1} [ A^T ( y^l  + y^u ) + z^l + z^u ] \\  & -  [ ( y^l  + y^u )^T A + ( z^l + z^u ]^T ) H^{-1} g - ( c^{l T} y^l + c^{u T} y^u +  x^{l T} z^l + x^{u T} z^u) \\ \mbox{subject to} & ( y^l, z^l ) \geq 0 \;\;\mbox{and} \;\;   (y^u, z^u) \leq 0,}$}\]
\endlatexonly
\htmlonly
$$\mbox{(4) $\arr{ll}{\mbox{minimize}\;\; q^D(y^l, y^u, z^l, z^u) = & \!\!\! \frac{1}{2} [ ( y^l  + y^u )^T A + ( z^l + z^u ]^T ) H^{-1} [ A^T ( y^l  + y^u ) + z^l + z^u ] \\  & -  [ ( y^l  + y^u )^T A + ( z^l + z^u ]^T ) H^{-1} g - ( c^{l T} y^l + c^{u T} y^u +  x^{l T} z^l + x^{u T} z^u) \\ \mbox{subject to} & ( y^l, z^l ) \geq 0 \;\;\mbox{and} \;\;   (y^u, z^u) \leq 0,}$}$$
\endhtmlonly
\manonly
  \n
  (4) minimize q^D(y^l, y^u, z^l, z^u) =
     1/2 [ ( y^l  + y^u )^T A + ( z^l + z^u ]^T ) H^{-1}
      [ A^T ( y^l  + y^u ) + z^l + z^u ]
     - [ ( y^l  + y^u )^T A + ( z^l + z^u ]^T ) H^{-1} g
     - ( c^{l T} y^l + c^{u T} y^u +  x^{l T} z^l + x^{u T} z^u
     subject to ( y^l, z^l ) >= 0 and(y^u, z^u) <= 0,
  \n
\endmanonly
  and then recovering the required solution from the linear system
\f[\mbox{$H x = - g + A^T ( y^l  + y^u ) + z^l + z^u.$}\f]
\manonly
  \n
   H x = - g + A^T ( y^l  + y^u ) + z^l + z^u.
  \n
\endmanonly
  The dual problem (4) is solved by an accelerated gradient-projection
  method comprising of alternating phases in which (i) the current
  projected dual gradient is traced downhill (the 'arc search')
  as far as possible and (ii) the  dual variables that
  are currently on their bounds are temporarily fixed and the unconstrained
  minimizer of \f$q^D(y^l, y^u, z^l, z^u)\f$ with respect to the
  remaining variables is sought; the minimizer in the second phase may itself
  need to be projected back into the dual feasible region (either
  using a brute-force backtrack or a second arc search).

  Both phases require
  the solution of sparse systems of symmetric linear equations, and these
  are handled by the GALAHAD matrix factorization package SBLS
  or the GALAHAD conjugate-gradient package GLTR.
  The systems are commonly singular, and this leads to a requirement to
  find the Fredholm Alternative for the given matrix and its right-hand side.
  In the non-singular case, there is an option to update existing factorizations
  using the "Schur-complement" approach given by the GALAHAD package SCU.

  Optionally, the problem may be pre-processed temporarily to eliminate
  dependentconstraints using the GALAHAD package FDC. This may improve the
  performance of the subsequent iteration.

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ constraint matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsection main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  Likewise, the symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ objective Hessian matrix
  \f$H\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry is exploited
  by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$H\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$H\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array H_val
  will hold the value \f$h_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$h_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$H\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$h_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays H_row and
  H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as H_ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$H\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = H_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_diagonal Diagonal storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is diagonal (i.e., \f$H_{ij} = 0\f$ for all
  \f$0 \leq i \neq j \leq n-1\f$) only the diagonals entries
  \f$H_{ii}\f$, \f$0 \leq i \leq n-1\f$ need
  be stored, and the first n components of the array H_val may be
  used for the purpose.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_scaled_identity Multiples of the identity storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is a multiple of the identity matrix, (i.e., \f$H = \alpha I\f$
  where \f$I\f$ is the n by n identity matrix and \f$\alpha\f$ is a scalar),
  it suffices to store \f$\alpha\f$ as the first component of H_val.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_identity The identity matrix format

  If \f$H\f$ is the identity matrix, no values need be stored.

   \example dqpt.c
   This is an example of how to use the package to solve a quadratic program.
   A variety of supported Hessian and constraint matrix storage formats are
   shown.

   Notice that C-style indexing is used, and that this is flaggeed by
   setting \c control.f_indexing to \c false.

    \example dqptf.c
   This is the same example, but now fortran-style indexing is used.\n
