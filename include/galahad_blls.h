  \section blls_intro Introduction

  \subsection blls_purpose Purpose

  This package uses a preconditioned, projected-gradient method to solve the
   <b>bound-constrained regularized linear least-squares problem</b>
  \f[\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = \frac{1}{2} \| A x - b\|_2^2 + \frac{1}{2} \sigma \|x\|^2\f]
\manonly
  \n
  minimize q(x) := 1/2 || A x - b ||^2 + sigma ||x||^2
  \n
\endmanonly
  subject to the simple bound constraints
  \f[x_j^l  \leq  x_j \leq x_j^u, \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   x_j^l \[<=] x_j \[<=] x_j^u, j = 1, ... , n,
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ real matrix \f$A\f$, the vectors
  \f$b\f$, \f$x^{l}\f$, \f$x^{u}\f$ and the non-negative weight
  \f$\sigma\f$ are given.   Any of the constraint bounds \f$x_j^l\f$ and
  \f$x_j^u\f$ may be infinite.  Full advantage is taken of any zero
  coefficients of the Jacobian matrix \f$A\f$ of the <b>residuals</b>
  \f$c(x) = A x - b\f$;  the matrix need not be provided as there are options
  to obtain matrix-vector products involving \f$A\f$ and its transpose either
  by reverse communication or from a user-provided subroutine.

  \subsection blls_terminology Terminology

  The required solution \f$x\f$ necessarily satisfies
  the primal optimality conditions
  \f[x^l \leq x \leq x^u,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   x^l \[<=] x \[<=] x^u,
  \n
\endmanonly
  the dual optimality conditions
  \f[(A^T A + \sigma I ) x = A^T b + z\f]
\manonly
  \n
   ( A^T A + sigma I ) x = A^T b + z
  \n
\endmanonly
  where
  \f[ z = z^l + z^u, \,\,
   z^l \geq 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\; z^u \leq 0,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   z = z^l + z^u, z^l \[>=] 0 and z^u \[<=] 0,
  \n
\endmanonly
  and the complementary slackness conditions
  \f[(x -x^l )^{T} z^l = 0 \;\;  \mbox{and} \;\; (x -x^u )^{T} z^u = 0,\hspace{12mm} \f]
\manonly
  \n
  (x -x^l)^T z^l = 0 and (x -x^u)^T z^u = 0,
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the vector \f$z\f$ is known as  the dual variables for the bounds,
  respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold component-wise.

  \subsection blls_method Method

  The method is iterative. Each iteration proceeds in two stages.
  Firstly, a search direction \f$s\f$ from the current estimate of the solution
  \f$x\f$ is computed. This may be in a scaled steepest-descent direction, or,
  if the working set of variables on bounds has not changed dramatically,
  in a direction that provides an approximate minimizer of the objective
  over a subspace comprising the currently free-variables. The latter is
  computed either using an appropriate sparse factorization by the
  GALAHAD package SBLS, or by the  conjugate-gradient least-squares (CGLS)
  method; tt may be necessary to regularize the subproblem very slightly to
  avoid a ill-posedness. Thereafter, a piecewise linesearch (arc search) is
  carried out along the arc \f$x(\alpha) = P( x + \alpha s)\f$ for
  \f$\alpha > 0\f$, where the projection operator is defined component-wise
  at any feasible point \f$v\f$ to be
  \f[P_j(v) = \min( \max( x_j, x_j^l), x_j^u);\f]
  thus this arc bends the search direction into the feasible region.
  The arc search is performed either exactly, by passing through a set
  of increasing breakpoints at which it changes direction, or inexactly,
  by evaluating a sequence of different \f$\alpha\f$  on the arc.
  All computation is designed to exploit sparsity in \f$A\f$.

  \subsection blls_call_order Call order

  To solve a given problem, functions from the blls package must be called
  in the following order:

  - \link blls_initialize \endlink - provide default control parameters and
      set up initial data structures
  - \link blls_read_specfile \endlink (optional) - override control values
      by reading replacement values from a file
  - set up problem data structures and fixed values by caling one of
     - \link blls_import \endlink - in the case that \f$A\f$ is explicitly
        available
     - \link blls_import_without_a \endlink - in the case that only the
        effect of applying \f$A\f$ and its transpose to a vector is possible
  - \link blls_reset_control \endlink (optional) - possibly change control
      parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved
  - solve the problem by calling one of
     - \link blls_solve_given_a \endlink - solve the problem using values
          of \f$A\f$
     - \link blls_solve_reverse_a_prod \endlink - solve the problem by returning
         to the caller for products of \f$A\f$ and its transpose with specified
          vectors
  - \link blls_information \endlink (optional) - recover information about
    the solution and solution process
  - \link blls_terminate \endlink - deallocate data structures

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense_row Dense row storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense_column Dense column storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by columns, that is,
  the values of the entries of each column in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$m \ast j + i\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessors.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_column_wise Sparse column-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in column j appear directly before those
  in column j+1. For the j-th column of \f$A\f$ the j-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this column,
  while A_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries.
  The row indices i, \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$, and values \f$A_{ij}\f$
  of the  nonzero entries in the j-th column are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(j), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(j+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_row, and real array A_val, respectively.
  Once again, for sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less
  storage than the dense of coordinate formats.
