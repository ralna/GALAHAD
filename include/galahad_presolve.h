  \section presolve_intro Introduction

  \subsection presolve_purpose Purpose

  Presolving aims to <b>improve the formulation of a given optimization
    problem by applying a sequence of simple transformations</b>, and thereby
  to produce a \a reduced problem in a \a standard \a form that should be
  simpler to solve.  This reduced problem may then be passed to an
  appropriate solver.  Once the reduced problem has been solved, it is
  then \a restored to recover the solution for the original formulation.

  This package applies presolving techniques to a <b>linear</b>
  \f[\mbox{minimize}\;\; l(x) = g^T x + f \f]
\manonly
  \n
  minimize l(x) := g^T x + f
  \n
\endmanonly
  or <b>quadratic program</b>
  \f[\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T H x + g^T x + f \f]
\manonly
  \n
  minimize q(x) := 1/2 x^T H x + g^T x + f
  \n
\endmanonly
  subject to the general linear constraints
  \f[c_i^l  \leq  a_i^Tx  \leq c_i^u, \;\;\; i = 1, \ldots , m,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   c_i^l \[<=] a_i^Tx \[<=] c_i^u, i = 1, ... , m,
  \n
\endmanonly
  and the simple bound constraints
  \f[x_j^l  \leq  x_j \leq x_j^u, \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   x_j^l \[<=] x_j \[<=] x_j^u, j = 1, ... , n,
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ symmetric matrix \f$H\f$,
  the vectors \f$g\f$, \f$a_i\f$, \f$c^l\f$, \f$c^u\f$, \f$x^l\f$,
  \f$x^u\f$ and the scalar \f$f\f$ are given.
  Any of the constraint bounds \f$c_i^l\f$, \f$c_i^u\f$,
  \f$x_j^l\f$ and \f$x_j^u\f$ may be infinite.

  In addition, bounds on the Lagrange multipliers \f$y\f$ associated with
  the general linear constraints and on the dual variables \f$z\f$ associated
  with the simple bound constraints
  \f[ y_{i}^{l}  \leq  y_{i}  \leq  y_{i}^{u}, \;\;\;  i = 1, \ldots , m,\f]

  are also provided, where the \f$m\f$-dimensional vectors \f$y^l\f$ and
  \f$y^u\f$, as well as the \f$n\f$-dimensional vectors \f$x^l\f$ and \f$x^u\f$

  \subsection presolve_method Method

  The purpose of presolving is to exploit these equations in order to reduce
  the problem to the standard form defined as follows:
  - The variables are ordered so that their bounds appear in the order
    \f[\begin{array}{lccccc}
      \mbox{free}            &          &        & x &        &        \\
      \mbox{non-negativity}  &   0      & \leq & x &    &        \\
      \mbox{lower}           & x^l & \leq & x &   &        \\
      \mbox{range} & x^l & \leq & x & \leq & x^u\\
      \mbox{upper} &          &        & x & \leq & x^u \\
      \mbox{non-positivity}  &          &        & x & \leq &  0
    \end{array}\f]
\manonly
  \n
    free                     x
    non-negativity     0  <= x
    lower             x^l <= x
    range             x^l <= x  <= x^u
    upper                    x  <= x^u
    non-positivity           x  <=  0
  \n
\endmanonly
    Fixed variables are removed. Within each category, the variables
    are further ordered so that those with non-zero diagonal Hessian
    entries occur before the remainder.
  - The constraints are ordered so that their bounds appear in the order
    \f[\begin{array}{lccccc}
    \mbox{non-negativity} &     0    & \leq & A x &        &      \\
    \mbox{equality}       & c^l &   =  & A x &        &     \\
    \mbox{lower} & c^l & \leq & A x &        &     \\
    \mbox{range} & c^l & \leq & A x & \leq & c^u\\
    \mbox{upper} &          &        & A x & \leq & c^u \\
    \mbox{non-positivity} &          &        & A x & \leq & 0  \\
    \end{array}\f]
\manonly
  \n
    non-negativity     0  <= A x
    equality          c^l  = A x
    lower             c^l <= A x
    range             c^l <= A x <= c^u
    upper                    A x <= c^u
    non-positivity           A x <=  0
  \n
\endmanonly
    Free constraints are removed.
  - In addition, constraints may be removed or bounds tightened, to reduce the
  size of the feasible region or simplify the problem if this is possible, and
  bounds may be tightened on the dual variables and the multipliers
  associated  with the problem.

  The presolving algorithm proceeds by applying a (potentially long) series of
  simple transformations to the problem, each transformation introducing a
  further simplification of the problem. These involve the removal of empty and
  singleton rows, the removal of redundant and forcing primal constraints, the
  tightening of primal and dual bounds, the exploitation of linear singleton,
  linear doubleton and linearly unconstrained columns, the merging dependent
  variables, row sparsification and split equalities. Transformations are
  applied in successive passes, each pass involving the following actions:

  -# remove empty and singletons rows,
  -# try to eliminate variables that are linearly unconstrained,
  -# attempt to exploit the presence of linear singleton columns,
  -# attempt to exploit the presence of linear doubleton columns,
  -# complete the analysis of the dual constraints,
  -# remove empty and singletons rows,
  -# possibly remove dependent variables,
  -# analyze the primal constraints,
  -# try to make \f$A\f$ sparser by combining its rows,
  -# check the current status of the variables, dual variables and multipliers.

  All these transformations are applied to the structure of the original
  problem, which is only permuted to standard form after all transformations are
  completed. <em>Note that the Hessian and Jacobian of the resulting reduced
  problem are always stored in sparse row-wise format.</em> The reduced problem
  is then solved by a quadratic or linear programming solver, thus ensuring
  sufficiently small primal-dual feasibility and complementarity. Finally, the
  solution of the simplified problem is re-translated in the
  variables/constraints/format of the original problem formulation by a
  \a restoration phase.

  If the number of problem transformations exceeds
  \p control.transf_buffer_size,  the transformation buffer size,
  then they are saved in a ``history'' file, whose
  name may be chosen by specifying the control.transf_file_name control
  parameter,  When this is the case, this file
  is subsequently reread by \p presolve_restore_solution. It must not be
  altered by the user.

  Overall, the presolving process follows one of the two sequences:

  \f[\fbox{initialize} \rightarrow \left[ \fbox{apply transformations}
   \rightarrow \mbox{(solve problem)}
   \rightarrow \fbox{restore} \right] \rightarrow \fbox{terminate}\f]
  or
  \f[\fbox{initialize} \rightarrow \left[ \fbox{read specfile}
   \rightarrow \fbox{apply transformations}
   \rightarrow \mbox{(solve problem)}
   \rightarrow \fbox{restore} \right] \rightarrow \fbox{terminate}\f]
\manonly
 (ignore garbled doxygen phrase)
  \n
 --------------    [  -------------------------
 | initialize | -> [ | apply transformations | -> (solve problem) ->
 --------------    [  -------------------------
                      ----------- ]    -------------
                      | restore | ] -> | terminate |
                      ----------- ]    -------------
 or
 --------------    [ -----------------    -------------------------
 | initialize | -> [ | read specfile | -> | apply transformations | ->
 --------------    [ -----------------    -------------------------
                                         ----------- ]    -------------
                      (solve problem) -> | restore | ] -> | terminate |
                                         ----------- ]    -------------
  \n
\endmanonly

  where the procedure's control parameter may be modified by
  reading the specfile, and where (solve problem) indicates that the reduced
   problem is solved. Each of the
  ``boxed'' steps in these sequences corresponds to calling a specific
  routine of the package In the diagrams above, brackated subsequence of
  steps means that they can be repeated with problem having the same
  structure. The value of the \p problem.new_problem_structure
  must be true on entry of \p presolve_apply_to_problem on the
  first time it is used in this repeated subsequence. Such a subsequence must
  be terminated by a call to  \p presolve_terminate before presolving is
  applied to a problem with a different structure.

  Note that the values of the multipliers and dual variables (and thus of
  their respective bounds) depend on the functional form assumed for the
  Lagrangian function associated with the problem.  This form is given by
  \f[  L(x,y,z) = q x) - y\_{sign} * y^T (Ax-c) - z\_{sign} * z,\f]
  (considering only active constraints \f$A x = c\f$), where the parameters
  y_{sign} and z_{sign} are +1 or -1 and can be chosen by the user.
  Thus, if \f$y_{sign}\f$ = +1, the multipliers associated to active constraints
  originally posed as inequalities are non-negative if the inequality is a lower
  bound and non-positive if it is an upper bound. Obvioulsy they are not
  constrained in sign for constraints originally posed as equalities. These
  sign conventions are reversed if \f$y_{sign}\f$ = -1.
  Similarly, if \f$z_{sign}\f$ = +1}, the dual variables associated to active
  bounds are non-negative if the original bound is an lower bound, non-positive
  if it is an upper bound, or unconstrained in sign if the variables is fixed;
  and this convention is reversed in \f$z\_{sign}\f$ = -1}. The values of
  \f$z_{sign}\f$ and \f$y_{sign}\f$ may be chosen by setting the corresponding
  components of the \p control structure to \p 1 or \p -1.

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ constraint matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsection main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  Likewise, the symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ objective Hessian matrix
  \f$H\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry is exploited
  by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$H\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$H\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array H_val
  will hold the value \f$h_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$h_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$H\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$h_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays H_row and
  H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as H_ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$H\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = H_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_diagonal Diagonal storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is diagonal (i.e., \f$H_{ij} = 0\f$ for all
  \f$0 \leq i \neq j \leq n-1\f$) only the diagonals entries
  \f$H_{ii}\f$, \f$0 \leq i \leq n-1\f$ need
  be stored, and the first n components of the array H_val may be
  used for the purpose.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_scaled_identity Multiples of the identity storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is a multiple of the identity matrix, (i.e., \f$H = \alpha I\f$
  where \f$I\f$ is the n by n identity matrix and \f$\alpha\f$ is a scalar),
  it suffices to store \f$\alpha\f$ as the first component of H_val.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_identity The identity matrix format

  If \f$H\f$ is the identity matrix, no values need be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_zero The zero matrix format

  The same is true if \f$H\f$ is the zero matrix.

   \example presolvet.c
   This is an example of how to use the package to solve a quadratic program.
   A variety of supported Hessian and constraint matrix storage formats are
   shown.

   Notice that C-style indexing is used, and that this is flaggeed by
   setting \c control.f_indexing to \c false.

    \example presolvetf.c
   This is the same example, but now fortran-style indexing is used.\n
