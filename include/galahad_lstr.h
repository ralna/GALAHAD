  \section lstr_intro Introduction

  \subsection lstr_purpose Purpose

  Given a real \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ matrix \f$A\f$, a real
  \f$m\f$ vector \f$b\f$ and a scalar \f$\Delta>0\f$, this package finds an
  <b> approximate minimizer of \f$\| A x - b\|_2\f$, where the vector
  \f$x\f$ is required to satisfy the ``trust-region''
  constraint \f$\|x\|_2 \leq  \Delta\f$.</b>
  This problem commonly occurs as a trust-region subproblem in nonlinear
  optimization calculations, and may be used to regularize the solution
  of under-determined or ill-conditioned linear least-squares problems.
  The method may be suitable for large \f$m\f$ and/or \f$n\f$ as no
  factorization involving \f$A\f$ is required. Reverse communication is used
  to obtain matrix-vector products of the form \f$u + A v\f$ and
  \f$v + A^T u\f$.

  \subsection lstr_terminology Terminology

  The required solution \f$x\f$ necessarily satisfies the optimality condition
  \f$A^T ( A x - b ) + \lambda x = 0\f$, where \f$\lambda \geq 0\f$
  is a Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the trust-region constraint
  \f$\|x\|_2  \leq  \Delta\f$.

  \subsection lstr_method Method

  The method is iterative. Starting  with the vector \f$u_1 = b\f$, a
  bi-diagonalisation process is used to generate the vectors \f$v_k\f$ and
  \f$u_k+1\f$ so that the \f$n\f$ by \f$k\f$ matrix \f$V_k = ( v_1 \ldots v_k)\f$
  and the \f$m\f$ by \f$(k+1)\f$ matrix \f$U_k = ( u_1 \ldots u_{k+1})\f$
  together satisfy
  \f[A V_k = U_{k+1} B_k \;\mbox{and}\; b = \|b\| U_{k+1} e_1,\f]
\manonly
\n
       A V_k = U_{k+1} B_k and b = ||b|| U_{k+1} e_1,
\n
\endmanonly
  where \f$B_k\f$ is \f$(k+1)\f$ by \f$k\f$ and lower bi-diagonal, \f$U_k\f$ and
  \f$V_k\f$ have orthonormal columns and \f$e_1\f$ is the first unit vector.
  The solution sought is of the form \f$x_k = V_k y_k\f$, where \f$y_k\f$
  solves the bi-diagonal least-squares trust-region problem
  \f[(1) \;\;\; \min \| B_k y - \|b\| e_1 \|_2 \;\mbox{subject to}\; \|y\|_2 \leq \Delta.\f]
\manonly
\n
   (1)    min || B_k y - \|b\| e_1 ||_2 subject to ||y||_2 <= Delta.
\n
\endmanonly

  If the trust-region constraint is inactive, the solution \f$y_k\f$
  may be found, albeit indirectly, via the LSQR algorithm of Paige and Saunders
  which solves the bi-diagonal least-squares problem
  \f[ \min \| B_k y - \|b\| e_1 \|_2\f]
\manonly
\n
     min || B_k y - ||b|| e_1 ||_2
\n
\endmanonly
  using a QR factorization of \f$B_k\f$. Only the most recent
  \f$v_k\f$ and \f$u_{k+1}\f$
  are required, and their predecessors discarded, to compute \f$x_k\f$ from
  \f$x_{k-1}\f$. This method has the important property that the iterates
  \f$y\f$ (and thus \f$x_k\f$) generated increase in norm with \f$k\f$. Thus as
  soon as an LSQR iterate lies outside the trust-region, the required solution
  to (1) and thus to the original problem must lie on the boundary of the
  trust-region.

  If the solution is so constrained, the simplest strategy is to interpolate
  the last interior iterate with the newly discovered exterior one to find the
  boundary point---the so-called Steihaug-Toint point---between them.
  Once the solution is known to lie on the trust-region boundary,
  further improvement may be made by solving
  \f[ \min \| B_k y - \|b\| e_1 \|_2 \;\mbox{subject to}\;  |\|y\|_2 = \Delta,\f]
\manonly
\n
     min || B_k y - ||b|| e_1 ||_2 subject to ||y||_2 = Delta,
\n
\endmanonly
  for which the optimality conditions require that \f$y_k = y(\lambda_k)\f$
  where \f$\lambda_k\f$ is the positive root of
  \f[B_k^T ( B_k^{} y(\lambda) - \|b\| e_1^{} ) + \lambda  y(\lambda) = 0 \;\mbox{and}\;  \|y(\lambda)\|_2 = \Delta\f]
\manonly
\n
      B_k^T ( B_k y(lambda) - ||b|| e_1 ) + lambda y(lambda) = 0
      and ||y(lambda)||_2 = Delta
\n
\endmanonly
  The vector \f$y(\lambda)\f$ is equivalently the solution to the
  regularized least-squares problem
  \f[\min  \left \| \vect{ B_k \\ \lambda^{\frac{1}{2}} I } y - \|b\| e_1^{} \right \|\f]
\manonly
\n
      min  ||  B_k y - ||b|| e_1 ||
           ||    lambda^{1/2} y  ||
\n
\endmanonly
  and may be found efficiently. Given  \f$y(\lambda)\f$, Newton's method
  is then used to find \f$\lambda_k\f$ as the positive root of
  \f$\|y(\lambda)\|_2 = \Delta\f$. Unfortunately, unlike when the solution
  lies in the interior of the trust-region, it is not known how to recur
  \f$x_k\f$ from \f$x_{k-1}\f$ given \f$y_k\f$, and a second pass in which
  \f$x_k = V_k y_k\f$ is regenerated is needed---this need only be done
  once \f$x_k\f$ has implicitly deemed to be sufficiently close to optimality.
  As this second pass is an additional expense, a record is kept of the
  optimal objective function values for each value of \f$k\f$, and the second
  pass is only performed so far as to ensure a given fraction of the
  final optimal objective value. Large savings may be made in the second
  pass by choosing the required fraction to be significantly smaller than one.

  \subsection lstr_call_order Call order

  To solve a given problem, functions from the lstr package must be called
  in the following order:

  - \link lstr_initialize \endlink - provide default control parameters and
      set up initial data structures
  - \link lstr_read_specfile \endlink (optional) - override control values
      by reading replacement values from a file
  - \link lstr_import_control \endlink - import control parameters prior to
      solution
  - \link lstr_solve_problem \endlink - solve the problem by reverse
      communication, a sequence of calls are made under control of a status
      parameter, each exit either asks the user to provide additional
      informaton and to re-enter, or reports that either the solution has
      been found or that an error has occurred
  - \link lstr_information \endlink (optional) - recover information about
    the solution and solution process
  - \link lstr_terminate \endlink - deallocate data structures
