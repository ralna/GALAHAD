  \section clls_intro Introduction

  \subsection clls_purpose Purpose

  This package uses a primal-dual interior-point crossover method
  to solve the <b>constrained linear least-squares problem</b>
  \f[\mbox{minimize}\;\; f(x) = \frac{1}{2} \| A x - b \|^2
    + \frac{1}{2} \sigma \| x \|^2 \f]
\manonly
  \n
  minimize f(x) := 1/2 ||Ax-b||^2 + 1/2 sigma ||x||^2
  \n
\endmanonly
  subject to the general linear constraints
  \f[c_i^l  \leq  l_i^Tx  \leq c_i^u, \;\;\; i = 1, \ldots , m,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   c_i^l \[<=] l_i^Tx \[<=] c_i^u, i = 1, ... , m,
  \n
\endmanonly
  and the simple bound constraints
  \f[x_j^l  \leq  x_j \leq x_j^u, \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   x_j^l \[<=] x_j \[<=] x_j^u, j = 1, ... , n,
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ matrix
  \f$A\f$, the vectors \f$l_i\f$, \f$c^l\f$, \f$c^u\f$, \f$x^l\f$,
  \f$x^u\f$ and the scalar \f$\sigma\f$ are given.
  Any of the constraint bounds \f$c_i^l\f$, \f$c_i^u\f$,
  \f$x_j^l\f$ and \f$x_j^u\f$ may be infinite.
  Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix \f$A\f$
  or the matrix \f$A\f$ of vectors \f$l_i\f$.

  where the diagonal matrix \f$W^2\f$ has diagonal entries \f$w_j^2\f$,
  \f$j = 1, \ldots , n\f$, where the vectors \f$y\f$ and \f$z\f$ are
  known as the Lagrange multipliers for
  the general linear constraints, and the dual variables for the bounds,
  respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold component-wise.

  \subsection clls_method Method

  Primal-dual interior point methods iterate towards a point
  that satisfies these conditions by ultimately aiming to satisfy
  (1a), (2a) and (3), while ensuring that (1b) and (2b) are
  satisfied as strict inequalities at each stage.  Appropriate norms of the
  amounts by  which (1a), (2a) and (3) fail to be satisfied are known as the
  primal and dual infeasibility, and the violation of complementary slackness,
  respectively. The fact that (1b) and (2b) are satisfied as strict
  inequalities gives such methods their other title, namely
  interior-point methods.

  The method aims at each stage to reduce the
  overall violation of (1a), (2a) and (3),
  rather than reducing each of the terms individually. Given an estimate
  \f$v = (x, c, y, y^l, y^u, z, z^l, z^u)\f$
  of the primal-dual variables, a correction
  \f$\Delta v = \Delta (x, c, y, y^l, y^u z, z^l, z^u)\f$
  is obtained by solving a suitable linear system of Newton equations for the
  nonlinear systems (1a), (2a) and a parameterized ``residual
  trajectory'' perturbation of (3); residual trajectories
  proposed by Zhang (1994) and Zhao and Sun (1999) are possibilities.
  An improved estimate \f$v + \alpha \Delta v\f$
  is then used, where the step-size \f$\alpha\f$
  is chosen as close to 1.0 as possible while ensuring both that
  (1b) and (2b) continue to hold and that the individual components
  which make up the complementary slackness
  (3) do not deviate too significantly
  from their average value. The parameter that controls the perturbation
  of (3) is ultimately driven to zero.

  The Newton equations are solved by applying the
  GALAHAD matrix factorization package SBLS, but there are options
  to factorize the matrix as a whole (the so-called "augmented system"
  approach), to perform a block elimination first (the "Schur-complement"
  approach), or to let the method itself decide which of the two
  previous options is more appropriate.
  The "Schur-complement" approach is usually to be preferred when all the
  weights are nonzero or when every variable is bounded (at least one side),
  but may be inefficient if any of the columns of \f$A\f$ is too dense.

  Optionally, the problem may be pre-processed temporarily to eliminate
  dependent constraints using the GALAHAD package FDC. This may
  improve the performance of the subsequent iteration.

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ constraint matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsection main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  Likewise, the symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ objective Hessian matrix
  \f$H\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry is exploited
  by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$H\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$H\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array H_val
  will hold the value \f$h_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$h_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$H\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$h_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays H_row and
  H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as H_ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$H\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = H_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_diagonal Diagonal storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is diagonal (i.e., \f$H_{ij} = 0\f$ for all
  \f$0 \leq i \neq j \leq n-1\f$) only the diagonals entries
  \f$H_{ii}\f$, \f$0 \leq i \leq n-1\f$ need
  be stored, and the first n components of the array H_val may be
  used for the purpose.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_scaled_identity Multiples of the identity storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is a multiple of the identity matrix, (i.e., \f$H = \alpha I\f$
  where \f$I\f$ is the n by n identity matrix and \f$\alpha\f$ is a scalar),
  it suffices to store \f$\alpha\f$ as the first component of H_val.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_identity The identity matrix format

  If \f$H\f$ is the identity matrix, no values need be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_zero The zero matrix format

  The same is true if \f$H\f$ is the zero matrix.

  \li -16. The problem is so ill-conditioned that further progress is
           impossible.
  \li -17. The step is too small to make further impact.
  \li -18. Too many iterations have been performed. This may happen if
         control.maxit is too small, but may also be symptomatic of
         a badly scaled problem.
  \li -19. The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen if
         control.cpu_time_limit is too small, but may also be symptomatic of
         a badly scaled problem.

   \example cllst.c
   This is an example of how to use the package to solve a quadratic program.
   A variety of supported Hessian and constraint matrix storage formats are
   shown.

   Notice that C-style indexing is used, and that this is flaggeed by
   setting \c control.f_indexing to \c false.

    \example cllstf.c
   This is the same example, but now fortran-style indexing is used.\n
