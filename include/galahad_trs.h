  \section trs_intro Introduction

  \subsection trs_purpose Purpose

  Given real \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ symmetric matrices \f$H\f$ and \f$M\f$
  (with \f$M\f$ diagonally dominant), another real \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$
  matrix \f$A\f$, a real \f$n\f$ vector \f$c\f$ and scalars
  \f$\Delta>0\f$ and \f$f\f$, this package finds a
  <b>global minimizer of the quadratic objective function
 \f$\frac{1}{2} x^T H  x + c^T x + f\f$,
  where the vector \f$x\f$ is required to satisfy
  the constraint \f$\|x\|_M \leq \Delta\f$ and possibly \f$A x =  0\f$,</b>
  and where the \f$M\f$-norm of \f$x\f$ is \f$\|x\|_M = \sqrt{x^T M x}\f$.
  This problem commonly occurs as a  trust-region subproblem in nonlinear
  optimization calculations.  The package may also be used to solve the
  related problem in which \f$x\f$ is
  instead required to satisfy the <b>equality constraint
  \f$\|x\|_M = \Delta\f$</b>.  The matrix \f$M\f$ need not be provided in
  the commonly-occurring \f$\ell_2\f$-trust-region case for which
  \f$M = I\f$, the \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ identity matrix.

  Factorization of matrices of the form \f$H + \lambda M\f$---or
  \f[\mbox{(1)}\;\;\; \mat{cc}{ H + \lambda M & A^T \\ A & 0}\f]
\manonly
\n
    (1)     ( H + lambda M   A^T )
            (      A          0  )
\n
\endmanonly
  in cases where \f$A x = 0\f$ is imposed---for a succession of
  scalars \f$\lambda\f$ will be required, so this package is most suited for
  the case where such a factorization may be found efficiently. If this is
  not the case, the GALAHAD package \c GLTR may be preferred.

  \subsection trs_method Method

  The method is iterative, and proceeds in two phases.  Firstly,
  lower and upper bounds, \f$\lambda_L\f$ and
  \f$\lambda_U\f$, on \f$\lambda_*\f$ are computed using
  Gershgorin's theorems and other eigenvalue bounds. The first phase of
  the computation proceeds by progressively shrinking the bound interval
  \f$[\lambda_L,\lambda_U]\f$
  until a value \f$\lambda\f$ for which \f$\|x(\lambda)\|_M \geq \Delta\f$
  is found.  Here \f$x(\lambda)\f$ and its companion \f$y(\lambda)\f$ are
  defined to be a solution of
  \f[\mbox{(2)}\;\;\; (H + \lambda M)x(\lambda)
   + A^T y(\lambda) = - c \;\mbox{and}\; A x(\lambda) = 0.\f]
\manonly
\n
   (2)    (H + lambda M)x(lambda) + A^T y(lambda) = - c and
                      A x(lambda) = 0;
\n
\endmanonly
  along the way the possibility that \f$H\f$ might be positive definite on
  the null-space of \f$A\f$ and \f$\|x(0)\|_M \leq \Delta\f$ is examined, and
  if this transpires the process is terminated with \f$x_* = x(0)\f$.
  Once the terminating \f$\lambda\f$ from the first phase has
  been discovered, the second phase consists of applying Newton or
  higher-order iterations to the nonlinear ``secular'' equation
  \f$\|x(\lambda)\|_M = \Delta\f$ with the knowledge that such
  iterations are both globally and ultimately rapidly convergent. It is
  possible in the ``hard'' case that the interval in the first-phase will
  shrink to the single point \f$\lambda_*\f$, and precautions are taken, using
  inverse iteration with Rayleigh-quotient acceleration to ensure that
  this too happens rapidly.

  The dominant cost is the requirement that we solve a sequence of linear
  systems (2). In the absence of linear constraints, an efficient
  sparse Cholesky factorization with precautions to detect indefinite
  \f$H + \lambda M\f$ is used. If \f$A x = 0\f$ is required, a sparse
  symmetric, indefinite factorization of (1) is used rather than a
  Cholesky factorization.

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ constraint matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsection main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  Likewise, the symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ objective Hessian matrix
  \f$H\f$ and scaling matrix \f$M\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry is exploited
  by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).
  In what follows, we refer to \f$H\f$ but this applies equally to \f$M\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$H\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$H\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array H_val
  will hold the value \f$h_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$h_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$H\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$h_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays H_row and
  H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as H_ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$H\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = H_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_diagonal Diagonal storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is diagonal (i.e., \f$H_{ij} = 0\f$ for all
  \f$0 \leq i \neq j \leq n-1\f$) only the diagonals entries
  \f$H_{ii}\f$, \f$0 \leq i \leq n-1\f$ need
  be stored, and the first n components of the array H_val may be
  used for the purpose.
