  \section nls_intro Introduction

  \subsection nls_purpose Purpose

  This package uses a <b>regularization method to find a (local)
  unconstrained minimizer of a differentiable weighted sum-of-squares objective
  function
  \f[\mathbf{f(x) :=
   \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^m w_i^{} c_i^2(x) \equiv \frac{1}{2} \|c(x)\|^2_W}\f]
\manonly
  \n
  f(x):= 1/2 sum_{i=1}^m w_i c_i^2(x) = 1/2 ||c(x)||^2_W
  \n
\endmanonly
  of many variables \f$\mathbf{x}\f$ involving positive weights
  \f$\mathbf{w_i}\f$, \f$\mathbf{i=1,\ldots,m}\f$.</b>
  The method offers the choice of direct and iterative solution of the key
  regularization subproblems, and is most suitable for large problems.
  First derivatives of the <i>residual function</i>
  \f$c(x)\f$ are required, and if second derivatives of the
  \f$c_i(x)\f$ can be calculated, they may be exploited---if suitable products
  of the first or second derivatives with a vector may be found but not the
  derivatives themselves, that can also be used to advantage.

  \subsection nls_terminology Terminology

  The \e gradient \f$\nabla_x f(x)\f$ of a function \f$f(x)\f$ is the vector
  whose \f$i\f$-th component is \f$\partial f(x)/\partial x_i\f$.
  The \e Hessian \f$\nabla_{xx} f(x)\f$ of \f$f(x)\f$ is the symmetric matrix
  whose \f$i,j\f$-th entry is \f$\partial^2 f(x)/\partial x_i \partial x_j\f$.
  The Hessian is \e sparse if a significant and useful proportion of the
  entries are universally zero.

  The algorithm used by the package is iterative. From the current best estimate
  of the minimizer \f$x_k\f$, a trial improved point \f$x_k + s_k\f$ is sought.
  The correction \f$s_k\f$ is chosen to improve a model \f$m_k(s)\f$ of
  %the stabilised objective function \f$f_{\rho,p}(x_k+s)\f$ built around
  the objective function \f$f(x_k+s)\f$ built around
  \f$x_k\f$. The model is the sum of two basic components,
  a suitable approximation \f$t_k(s)\f$ of \f$f(x_k+s)\f$,
  %another approximation of \f$(\rho/r) \|x_k+s\|_r^r\f$
  (if \f$\rho > 0\f$),
  and a regularization term \f$(\sigma_k/p) \|s\|_{S_k}^p\f$
  involving a weight \f$\sigma_k\f$, power \f$p\f$ and
  a norm \f$\|s\|_{S_k} := \sqrt{s^T S_k s}\f$ for a given positive
  definite scaling matrix \f$S_k\f$ that is included to prevent large
  corrections. The weight  \f$\sigma_k\f$ is adjusted as the algorithm
  progresses to  ensure convergence.

  The model \f$t_k(s)\f$ is a truncated Taylor-series approximation, and this
  relies on being able to compute or estimate derivatives of \f$c(x)\f$.
  Various models are provided, and each has different derivative requirements.
  We denote the \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ <i>residual Jacobian</i>
  \f$J(x) \equiv \nabla_x c(x)\f$ as the matrix  whose \f$i,j\f$-th component
  \f[J(x)_{i,j} := \partial c_i(x) / \partial x_j \;\;
  \mbox{for $i=1,\ldots,m$ and $j=1,\ldots,n$.}\f]
\manonly
  \n
  J(x)_{i,j} := partial c_i(x) / \partial x_j
  \n
\endmanonly
\manonly for i=1,...,m and j=1,...,n.\endmanonly
  For a given \f$m\f$-vector \f$y\f$, the
  <i>weighted-residual Hessian</i> is the sum
  \f[H(x,y) := \sum_{\ell=1}^m y_\ell H_\ell(x),
  \;\; \mbox{where}\;\;
  H_\ell(x)_{i,j} := \partial^2 c_\ell(x) / \partial x_i \partial x_j
  \;\; \mbox{for $i,j=1,\ldots,n$}\f]
\manonly
  \n
  H(x,y) := sum_{\ell=1}^m y_\ell H_\ell(x), where
  \n
  H_l(x)_{i,j} := partial^2 c_l(x) / partial x_i partial x_j
  \n
for i,j=1,...,n\endmanonly
  is the Hessian of \f$c_\ell(x)\f$.
  Finally, for a given vector \f$v\f$, we define
  the <i>residual-Hessians-vector product matrix</i>
  \f[P(x,v) := (H_1(x) v, \ldots, H_m(x) v).\f]
\manonly
  \n
  P(x,v) := (H_1(x) v, ..., H_m(x) v).
  \n
\endmanonly
  The models \f$t_k(s)\f$ provided are,
  -# the first-order Taylor approximation \f$f(x_k) + g(x_k)^T s\f$,
  where
  \f$g(x) = J^T(x) W c(x)\f$,
  -# a barely second-order approximation
  \f$f(x_k) + g(x_k)^T s + \frac{1}{2} s^T W s\f$,
  -# the Gauss-Newton approximation
  \f$\frac{1}{2} \| c(x_k) + J(x_k) s\|^2_W\f$,
  -# the Newton (second-order Taylor) approximation
    \f$f(x_k) + g(x_k)^T s + \frac{1}{2} s^T
    [ J^T(x_k) W J(x_k) + H(x_k,W c(x_k))] s\f$, and
  -# the tensor Gauss-Newton approximation
  \f$\frac{1}{2} \| c(x_k) + J(x_k) s +
   \frac{1}{2} s^T \cdot P(x_k,s) \|^2_W\f$,
  where the \f$i\f$-th component of \f$s^T \cdot P(x_k,s)\f$ is
  shorthand for the scalar \f$s^T H_i(x_k) s\f$,
  where \f$W\f$ is the diagonal matrix of weights
  \f$w_i\f$, \f$i = 1, \ldots m\f$.

  Access to a particular model requires that the user is either able to
  provide the derivatives needed (``<i>matrix available</i>'')
  or that the products
  of these derivatives (and their transposes) with specified vectors are
  possible (``<i>matrix free</i>'').

  \subsection nls_method Method

  An adaptive regularization method is used.
  In this, an improvement to a current
  estimate of the required minimizer, \f$x_k\f$ is sought by computing a
  step \f$s_k\f$. The step is chosen to approximately minimize a model
  \f$t_k(s)\f$ of \f$f_{\rho,r}(x_k+s)\f$
  that includes a weighted regularization term
  \f$(\sigma_k/p) \|s\|_{S_k}^p\f$
  for some specified positive weight \f$\sigma_k\f$. The quality of the
  resulting step \f$s_k\f$ is assessed by computing the "ratio"
  %\f$(f_{\rho,p}(x_k) - f_{\rho,p}(x_k+s_k))/(t_k(0)-t_k(s_k))\f$.
  \f$(f(x_k) - f(x_k + s_k))/(t_k(0) - t_k(s_k))\f$.
  The step is deemed to have succeeded if the ratio exceeds a given
  \f$\eta_s > 0\f$,
  and in this case \f$x_{k+1} = x_k + s_k\f$. Otherwise
  \f$x_{k+1} = x_k\f$, and the weight is increased by powers of a given
  increase factor up to a given limit. If the ratio is larger than
  \f$\eta_v \geq \eta_d\f$, the weight will be decreased by powers of a given
  decrease factor again up to a given limit. The method will terminate
  as soon as \f$f(x_k)\f$ or
  \f$\|\nabla_x f(x_k)\|\f$ is smaller than a specified value.

  A choice of linear, quadratic or quartic models \f$t_k(s)\f$ is available
  (see the \ref nls_terminology section), and normally a two-norm
  regularization will  be used, but this may change if preconditioning
  is employed.

  If linear or quadratic models are employed, an appropriate,
  approximate model minimizer is found using either a direct approach
  involving factorization of a shift of the model Hessian \f$B_k\f$ or an
  iterative (conjugate-gradient/Lanczos) approach based on approximations
  to the required solution from a so-called Krlov subspace. The direct
  approach is based on the knowledge that the required solution
  satisfies the linear system of equations \f$(B_k + \lambda_k I) s_k
  = - \nabla_x f(x_k)\f$ involving a scalar Lagrange multiplier \f$\lambda_k\f$.
  This multiplier is found by uni-variate root finding, using a safeguarded
  Newton-like process, by the GALAHAD packages RQS. The iterative approach
  uses the GALAHAD packag GLRT, and is best accelerated by preconditioning
  with good approximations to the Hessian of the model using GALAHAD's PSLS. The
  iterative approach has the advantage that only Hessian matrix-vector products
  are required, and thus the Hessian \f$B_k\f$ is not required explicitly.
  However when factorizations of the Hessian are possible, the direct approach
  is often more efficient.

  When a quartic model is used, the model is itself of least-squares form,
  and the package calls itself recursively to approximately minimize its
  model. The quartic model often gives a better approximation, but at the
  cost of more involved derivative requirements.

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ Jacobian matrix
  \f$J \equiv \nabla_x c(x)\f$ and the residual-Hessians-vector
  product matrix $P(x,v)$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats. Let
  \f$A\f$ be \f$J\f$ or \f$P\f$ as appropriate.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense_cols Dense by columns storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by columns, that is,
  the values of the entries of each column in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$m \ast j + i\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_column_wise Sparse column-wise storage format

  Once again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in column j appear directly before those
  in column j+1. For the j-th column of \f$A\f$ the j-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this column,
  while A_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The row indices i, \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$, and values \f$A_{ij}\f$
  of the  nonzero entries in the j-th columnsare stored in components
  l = A_ptr(j), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(j+1)-1, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_row, and real array A_val, respectively.
  As before, for sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less
  storage than the co-ordinate format.

  \subsection main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  Likewise, the symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ weighted-residual
  Hessian matrix \f$H = H(x,y)\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry is exploited
  by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$H\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$H\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array H_val
  will hold the value \f$h_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$h_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$H\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$h_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays H_row and
  H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as H_ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$H\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = H_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_diagonal Diagonal storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is diagonal (i.e., \f$H_{ij} = 0\f$ for all
  \f$0 \leq i \neq j \leq n-1\f$) only the diagonals entries
  \f$H_{ii}\f$, \f$0 \leq i \leq n-1\f$ need
  be stored, and the first n components of the array H_val may be
  used for the purpose.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_scaled_identity Multiples of the identity storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is a multiple of the identity matrix, (i.e., \f$H = \alpha I\f$
  where \f$I\f$ is the n by n identity matrix and \f$\alpha\f$ is a scalar),
  it suffices to store \f$\alpha\f$ as the first component of H_val.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_identity The identity matrix format

  If \f$H\f$ is the identity matrix, no values need be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_zero The zero matrix format

  The same is true if \f$H\f$ is the zero matrix.

    On initial entry, status must be set to 1. \n
    Possible exit are:
  \li  0. The run was succesful

  \li -1. An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending

  \li -3. The restriction n > 0 or requirement that type contains
       its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate', 'sparse_by_rows',
       'diagonal' or 'absent' has been violated.
  \li -9. The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the return status
         from the factorization package is given in the component
         inform.factor_status
  \li -10. The factorization failed; the return status from the factorization

  \li -11. The solution of a set of linear equations using factors from the
         factorization package failed; the return status from the factorization
         package is given in the component inform.factor_status.
  \li -16. The problem is so ill-conditioned that further progress is
           impossible.
  \li -17. The step is too small to make further impact.
  \li -18. Too many iterations have been performed. This may happen if
         control.maxit is too small, but may also be symptomatic of
         a badly scaled problem.
  \li -19. The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen if
         control.cpu_time_limit is too small, but may also be symptomatic of
         a badly scaled problem.
  \li -82. The user has forced termination of solver by removing the file
         named control.alive_file from unit unit control.alive_unit.

  \li  2. The user should compute the vector of residuals \f$c(x)\f$ at
         the point \f$x\f$ indicated in x and then re-enter the function.
         The required value should be set in c, and eval_status should be
