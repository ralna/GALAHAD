  \section glrt_intro Introduction

  \subsection glrt_purpose Purpose

  Given real \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ symmetric matrices \f$H\f$ and \f$M\f$
  (with \f$M\f$ positive definite), real
  \f$n\f$ vector \f$c\f$, and scalars \f$\sigma\geq 0\f$
   and \f$f_0\f$, this package finds an
  <b> approximate minimizer of the regularised quadratic objective function</b>
  \f[\frac{1}{2} x^T H x + c^T x + f_0 +  \frac{1}{p} \sigma \|x\|_M^p,\f]
\manonly
\n
1/2 x^T H x + c^T x + f_0 + 1/p sigma ||x||^p_M,
\n
\endmanonly
  where \f$\|  v \|_M = \sqrt{v^T M v}\f$ is  the \f$M\f$-norm of \f$v\f$.
  This problem commonly occurs as a subproblem in nonlinear optimization
  calculations involving cubic regularisation. The method may be suitable
  for large \f$n\f$ as no factorization of \f$H\f$ is required.
  Reverse communication is used to obtain matrix-vector products of the
  form \f$H z\f$ and \f$M^{-1} z\f$.

  \subsection glrt_terminology Terminology

  \subsection glrt_method Method

  The required solution \f$x\f$ necessarily satisfies the optimality condition
  \f$H x + \lambda M x + c + \lambda o = 0\f$, where
  \f$\lambda = \sigma [ \|x\|_M^2]^{p/2-1}\f$.
  In addition, the matrix \f$H + \lambda M\f$ will be positive semi-definite.

  The method is iterative. Starting  with the vector \f$M^{-1} c\f$,
  a matrix of Lanczos vectors is built one column at a time
  so that the \f$k\f$-th column is generated during
  iteration \f$k\f$. These columns span a so-called Krylov space.
  The resulting \f$n\f$ by \f$k\f$ matrix \f$Q_k \f$ has the
  property that \f$Q_k^T H Q_k  =  T_k \f$,
  where \f$T_k\f$ is tridiagonal. An approximation to the
  required solution may then be expressed formally as
  \f[x_{k+1}  =  Q_k y_k,\f]
\manonly
\n
   x_{k+1}  =  Q_k y_k
\n
\endmanonly
  where \f$y_k \f$ solves the ``tridiagonal'' subproblem of minimizing
  \f[(1) \;\;\; \frac{1}{2} y^T T_k y  + \| c\|_{M^{-1}} e_1^T y + \frac{1}{p} \sigma \| y \|^p_2,\f]
\manonly
\n
  (1) 1/2  y^T T_k y  + \| c\|_{M^{-1}} e_1^T y + 1/p sigma || y ||^p_2,
\n
\endmanonly
  where \f$e_1\f$ is the first unit vector.

  To minimize (1), the optimality conditions
  \f[(2) \;\;\; ( T_k + \lambda I ) y(\lambda) = - c - \lambda d,\f]
\manonly
\n
  (2)   ( T_k + lambda I ) y(lambda) = - c - lambda d,
\n
\endmanonly
  where \f$\lambda = \sigma \|y(\lambda)+d\|^{p-2}_M\f$
  are used as the basis of an iteration. Specifically, given an estimate
  \f$\lambda\f$ for which \f$ T_k + \lambda I\f$ is positive definite,
  the tridiagonal system (2) may be efficiently solved to give
  \f$y(\lambda)\f$. It is then simply a matter of adjusting \f$\lambda\f$
  (for example by a Newton-like process) to solve the scalar nonlinear equation
  \f[(3) \;\;\; \theta(\lambda) \equiv \|y(\lambda)+d\|^{p-2}_M - \frac{\lambda}{\sigma} = 0.\f]
\manonly
\n
  (3) theta(lambda) =  ||y(\lambda)+d||^{p-2}_M - lambda/sigma = 0.
\n
\endmanonly
  In practice (3) is reformulated, and a more rapidly converging iteration is
  used.

  It is possible to measure the optimality measure
  \f$\|H x  +  \lambda M x  +  c + \lambda o\|_{M^{-1}}\f$
  without computing \f$x_{k+1}\f$, and thus without
  needing \f$Q_k \f$. Once this measure is sufficiently small, a second pass
  is required to obtain the estimate \f$x_{k+1} \f$ from \f$y_k \f$.
  As this second pass is an additional expense, a record is kept of the
  optimal objective function values for each value of \f$k\f$, and the second
  pass is only performed so far as to ensure a given fraction of the
  final optimal objective value. Large savings may be made in the second
  pass by choosing the required fraction to be significantly smaller than one.

  Special code is used in the special case \f$p=2\f$, as in this case a single
  pass suffices.

  \subsection glrt_call_order Call order

  To solve a given problem, functions from the glrt package must be called
  in the following order:

  - \link glrt_initialize \endlink - provide default control parameters and
      set up initial data structures
  - \link glrt_read_specfile \endlink (optional) - override control values
      by reading replacement values from a file
  - \link glrt_import_control \endlink - import control parameters prior to
      solution
  - \link glrt_solve_problem \endlink - solve the problem by reverse
      communication, a sequence of calls are made under control of a status
      parameter, each exit either asks the user to provide additional
      informaton and to re-enter, or reports that either the solution has
      been found or that an error has occurred
  - \link glrt_information \endlink (optional) - recover information about
    the solution and solution process
  - \link glrt_terminate \endlink - deallocate data structures
