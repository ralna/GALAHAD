  \subsection wcp_purpose Purpose

  This package uses a primal-dual interior-point method
  to <b>find a well-centered interior point</b> \f$x\f$ for a set of
  general linear constraints
  \f[\mbox{(1)} \;\; c_i^l \leq a_i^Tx \leq c_i^u, \;\;\; i = 1, \ldots , m,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   (1) c_i^l \[<=] a_i^Tx \[<=] c_i^u, i = 1, ... , m,
  \n
\endmanonly
  and the simple bound constraints
  \f[\mbox{(2)} \;\; x_j^l \leq x_j \leq x_j^u, \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   (2) x_j^l \[<=] x_j \[<=] x_j^u, j = 1, ... , n,
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the vectors
  \f$a_{i}\f$, \f$c^l\f$, \f$c^u\f$, \f$x^l\f$ and \f$x^u\f$ are given.
  More specifically, if possible, the package finds a solution to the
  system of primal optimality equations
  \f[\mbox{(3)} \;\; A x = c,\f]

  (3) A x = c,

  dual optimality equations

\manonly
  \n
  (4) g = A^T y + z, y = y^l + y^u and z = z^l + z^u,

\endmanonly
  and perturbed complementary slackness equations
  \f[\mbox{(5)} \;\;
  ( c_i - c^l_i ) y^l_i = (\mu_c^l)_i \;\mbox{and}\;
  ( c_i - c_i^u ) y^u_i = (\mu_c^u)_i, \;\;\;
   i = 1, \ldots , m, \f]

  (c_i - c^l_i) y^l_i = (mu_c^l)_i and
  (c_i - c_i^u) y^u_i = (mu_c^u)_i, i = 1,...,m,
  \n
\endmanonly
  and
  \f[\mbox{(6)} \;\;
  ((x_j - x^l_j ) z_j^l = (\mu_x^l)_j \;\mbox{and}\;

  (x_j - c^l_j) z^l_j = (mu_x^l)_j and
  (x_j - x_j^u) z^u_j = (mu_x^u)_i, j = 1,...,n,
  \n
\endmanonly
  for which
\latexonly
  \[
\mbox{(7)} \;\; c^l \leq c \leq c^u, \;\; x^l \leq x \leq x^u, \;\;
y^l \geq 0 , \;\; y^u \leq 0 , \;\; z^l \geq 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\; z^u \leq 0

  (7) c^l \[<=] c \[<=] c^u, x^l \[<=] x \[<=] x^u,
      y^l \[>=] 0, y^u \[<=] 0, z^l \[>=] 0 and z^u \[<=] 0
  \n
\endmanonly
  Here \f$A\f$ is the matrix whose rows are the \f$a_i^T\f$, \f$i = 1,
  \ldots , m\f$, \f$\mu_c^l\f$, \f$\mu_c^u\f$, \f$\mu_x^l\f$ and
  \f$\mu_x^u\f$ are vectors of strictly positive {\em targets}, \f$g\f$
  is another given target vector, and \f$(y^l, y^u)\f$ and \f$(z^l,
  z^u)\f$ are dual variables for the linear constraints and simple
  bounds respectively; \f$c\f$ gives the constraint value \f$A x\f$.

  (8) c^l < c < c^u, x^l <; x < x^u,
      y^l > 0, y^u < 0, z^l > 0 and z^u < 0
  \n
\endmanonly
  such a primal-dual point \f$(x, c, y^l, y^u, z^l, z^l)\f$
  may be used, for example, as a feasible starting point for primal-dual
  interior-point methods for solving the linear programming problem
  of minimizing \f$g^T x\f$ subject to (1) and (2).

  Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the vectors
  \f$a_{i}\f$. Any of the constraint bounds \f$c_{i}^l\f$,
  \f$c_{i}^u\f$, \f$x_{j}^l\f$ and \f$x_{j}^u\f$ may be infinite.
  The package identifies infeasible problems, and problems for which
  there is no strict interior, that is one or more of (8)
  only holds as an equality for all feasible points.

\endmanonly
  for some \f$\gamma \in (0,1]\f$ which is allowed to be smaller than one
  if there is a nonzero perturbation.

  Given any solution to (3)-(4) and (12) satisfying (11),
  the perturbations are reduced (sometimes to zero) so as to ensure that the
  current solution is feasible for the next perturbed problem. Specifically,
  the perturbation \f$(\theta^l_c)_i\f$ for the constraint \f$c_i \geq c^l_i\f$
  is set to zero if \f$c_i\f$ is larger than some given parameter
  \f$\epsilon > 0\f$.
  If not, but \f$c_i\f$ is strictly positive, the perturbation will be
  reduced by a multiplier \f$\rho \in (0,1)\f$. Otherwise, the new perturbation
  will be set to \f$\xi (\theta^l_c)_i + ( 1 - \xi ) ( c_i^l - c_i )\f$
  for some factor \f$\xi \in (0,1)\f$. Identical rules are used to reduce the
  remaining primal and dual perturbations.
  The targets \f$\mu_c^l\f$, \f$\mu_c^u\f$, \f$\mu_x^l\f$ and \f$\mu_x^u\f$
  will also be increased by the factor \f$\beta \geq 1\f$ for those
  (primal and/or dual) variables with strictly
  positive perturbations so as to try to accelerate the convergence.

  Ultimately the intention is to drive all the perturbations to zero.
  It can be shown that if the original problem (3)-(6) and (8)
  has a solution, the perturbations will be zero after a finite number of major
  iterations. Equally, if there is no interior solution (8)
  the sets of (primal and dual) variables that are necessarily at (one of) their
  bounds for all feasible points---we refer to these as {\em implicit}
  equalities---will be identified, as will the possibility that there is
  no point (interior or otherwise) in the primal and/or dual feasible regions.

  Each major iteration requires the solution \f$u = (x,c,z^l,z^u,y^l,y^u)\f$
  of the nonlinear system (3), (4) and (9)-(11)
  for fixed perturbations, using a minor iteration. The minor iteration
  uses a stabilized (predictor-corrector) Newton method, in which the arc

  for some \f$\tau \in (0,1)\f$, always holds, and also so that the norm
  of the residuals to (3), (4), (9) and (10)
  is reduced as much as possible.
  The Newton and corrector systems are solved using a factorization of
  the Jacobian of its defining functions (the so-called ``augmented system''
  approach) or of a reduced system in which some of the trivial equations are
  eliminated (the ``Schur-complement'' approach).
  The factors are obtained using the GALAHAD package SBLS.

  In order to make the solution as efficient as possible, the
  variables and constraints are reordered internally
  by the GALAHAD package QPP prior to solution.
  In particular, fixed variables, and
  free (unbounded on both sides) constraints are temporarily removed.
  In addition, an attempt to identify and remove linearly dependent
  equality constraints may be made by factorizing

  \mat{cc}{\alpha I & A^T_E \\ A_E & 0},
  \]

  where \f$A_E\f$ denotes the gradients of the equality constraints and
  \f$\alpha > 0\f$ is a given scaling factor,
  using the GALAHAD package SBLS, and examining small pivot blocks.

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ constraint matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based) and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format
  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$ of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1, \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

   \example wcpt.c
   This is an example of how to use the package to solve a quadratic program.
   A variety of supported Hessian and constraint matrix storage formats are
   shown.

   Notice that C-style indexing is used, and that this is flaggeed by
   setting \c control.f_indexing to \c false.

    \example wcptf.c
   This is the same example, but now fortran-style indexing is used.\n
