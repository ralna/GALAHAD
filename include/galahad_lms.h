  \section lms_intro Introduction

  \subsection lms_purpose Purpose

  Given a sequence of vectors
  \latexonly
$\{s_k\}$ and $\{y_k\}$ \mbox{and scale factors} $\{\delta_k\}$,
  \endlatexonly
  \htmlonly
{s<sub>k</sub>} and {y<sub>k</sub>} and scalars {&#948<sub>k</sub>},
  \endhtmlonly
\manonly
{s_k} and {y_k} and scalars {delta_k},
\endmanonly
<b>obtain the product of a limited-memory secant
  approximation \f$H_k\f$ (or its inverse) with a given vector</b>,
  using one of a variety of well-established formulae.

  Currently, only the control and inform parameters are exposed;
  these are provided and used by other GALAHAD packages with C interfaces.

  \subsection lms_method Method

  Given a sequence of vectors
  \latexonly
$\{s_k\}$ and $\{y_k\}$ \mbox{and scale factors} $\{\delta_k\}$,
  \endlatexonly
  \htmlonly
{s<sub>k</sub>} and {y<sub>k</sub>} and scalars {&#948<sub>k</sub>},
  \endhtmlonly
\manonly
{s_k} and {y_k} and scalars {delta_k},
\endmanonly
a limited-memory secant approximation \f$H_k\f$ is chosen
 so that \f$H_{\max(k-m,0)} = \delta_k I\f$, \f$H_{k-j} s_{k-j} = y_{k-j}\f$
 and \f$\| H_{k-j+1} - H_{k-j}\|\f$ is ``small'' for
\f$j = \min(k-1,m-1), \ldots, 0\f$.
Different ways of quantifying ``small'' distinguish different methods,
but the crucial observation is that it is possible to construct
\f$H_k\f$ quickly from \f${s_k}\f$, \f${y_k}\f$ and \f$\delta_k\f$,
 and to apply it and its inverse  to a given vector \f$v\f$.
 It is also possible to apply similar formulae to the ``shifted'' matrix
\f$H_k + \lambda_k I\f$ that occurs in trust-region methods.
