  \section uls_intro Introduction

  \subsection uls_purpose Purpose

  This package
  <b> solves dense or sparse unsymmetric systems of linear equations</b>
  using variants of Gaussian elimination.
  Given a sparse symmetric \f$m \times n\f$ matrix \f$A = a_{ij}\f$, and an
  \f$m\f$-vector \f$b\f$, this subroutine solves the system \f$A x = b\f$. If
  \f$b\f$ is an \f$n\f$-vector, the package may solve instead the system
  \f$A^T x = b\f$. Both square (\f$m=n\f$) and
  rectangular (\f$m \neq n\f$)  matrices are handled; one of an infinite
  class of solutions for consistent systems will be returned
  whenever \f$A\f$ is not of full rank.

  The method provides a common interface to a variety of well-known solvers
  from HSL and elsewhere. Currently supported solvers include \c MA28/GLS 
  and \c HSL\_MA48 from HSL, as well as \c GETR from LAPACK.
  Note that, with the exception of he Netlib reference LAPACK code,
  <b> the solvers themselves do not form part of this package
  and must be obtained separately.</b>
  Dummy instances are provided for solvers that are unavailable.
  Also note that additional flexibility may be obtained by calling the
  solvers directly rather that via this package.

  \subsection uls_authors Authors

  N. I. M. Gould, STFC-Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, England.

  C interface, additionally J. Fowkes, STFC-Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.

  Julia interface, additionally A. Montoison and D. Orban, Polytechnique Montr√©al.

  \subsection uls_date Originally released

  August 2009,  C interface December 2021.

  \subsection uls_terminology Terminology

  The solvers used each produce an \f$P_R L U P_C\f$ factorization
  of \f$A\f$, where \f$L\f$ and \f$U\f$ are lower and upper triangular
  matrices, and \f$P_R\f$ and \f$P_C\f$ are row and column permutation
  matrices respectively.

  \subsection uls_method Method

  Variants of sparse Gaussian elimination are used.

  The solver \c GLS is available as part of GALAHAD and relies on
  the HSL Archive packages \c MA33. To obtain HSL Archive packages, see

    http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/archive/ .

  The solver \c HSL\_MA48 is part of HSL 2007. To obtain HSL 2007 packages, see

    http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/hsl2007/ .

    \subsection uls_references Reference

  The methods used are described in the user-documentation for

    HSL 2007, A collection of {F}ortran codes for large-scale scientific
    computation (2007).  \n
    http://www.cse.clrc.ac.uk/nag/hsl

  The solver \c GETR is available as \c S/DGETRF/S as part of LAPACK. 
  Reference versions are provided by GALAHAD, but for good performance
  machined-tuned versions should be used.

  \subsection uls_call_order Call order

  To solve a given problem, functions from the uls package must be called
  in the following order:

  - \link uls_initialize \endlink - provide default control parameters and
      set up initial data structures
  - \link uls_read_specfile \endlink (optional) - override control values
      by reading replacement values from a file
  - \link uls_factorize_matrix \endlink - set up matrix data structures,
       analyse the structure to choose a suitable order for factorization,
       and then factorize the matrix \f$A\f$
  - \link uls_reset_control \endlink (optional) - possibly change control
      parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved
  - \link uls_solve_system \endlink - solve the linear system of
        equations \f$Ax=b\f$ or \f$A^Tx=b\f$
  - \link uls_information \endlink (optional) - recover information about
    the solution and solution process
  - \link uls_terminate \endlink - deallocate data structures

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$  matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

   \example ulst.c
   This is an example of how to use the package in conjunction with the
   sparse linear solver \c sils.
   A variety of supported matrix storage formats are illustrated.

   Notice that C-style indexing is used, and that this is flaggeed by
   setting \c control.f_indexing to \c false.

    \example ulstf.c
   This is the same example, but now fortran-style indexing is used.\n
