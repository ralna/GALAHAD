  \section lhs_intro Introduction

  \subsection lhs_purpose Purpose

  This package <b>computes an array of Latin Hypercube samples.</b>.

  Currently, only the control and inform parameters are exposed;
  these are provided and used by other GALAHAD packages with C interfaces.

  \subsection lhs_authors Authors

  J. Burkardt, University of Pittsburgh (LGPL) adapted for GALAHAD by
  N. I. M. Gould, STFC-Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, England.

  C interface, additionally J. Fowkes, STFC-Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.

  Julia interface, additionally A. Montoison and D. Orban, Polytechnique Montr√©al.

  \subsection lhs_date Originally released

  June 2016, C interface March 2022.

/*!<
  The improved distributed hyper-cube sampling algorithm.

  Discussion:

  n_points points in an n_dimen dimensional Latin hyper-cube are
  to be selected. Each of the coordinate dimensions is discretized
  to the values 1 through n.  The points are to be chosen in such
  a way that no two points have any coordinate value in common.
  This is a standard Latin hypercube requirement, and there are
  many solutions.

  This algorithm differs in that it tries to pick a solution
  which has the property that the points are "spread out"
  as evenly as possible.  It does this by determining an optimal
  even spacing, and using the DUPLICATION factor to allow it
  to choose the best of the various options available to it.
