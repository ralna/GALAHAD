  \section fdc_intro Introduction

  \subsection fdc_purpose Purpose

  Given an under-determined set of linear equations/constraints
  \f$a_i^T x = b_i^{}\f$, \f$i = 1, \ldots, m\f$ involving
  \f$n \geq m\f$ unknowns \f$x\f$, this package
  <b>determines whether the constraints are consistent, and if
  so how many of the constraints are dependent</b>; a list of dependent
  constraints, that is, those which may be removed without changing the
  solution set, will be found and the remaining \f$a_i\f$ will be linearly
  independent.  Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the
  vectors \f$a_i\f$.

  \subsection fdc_method Method

  A choice of two methods is available. In the first, the matrix
  \f[K = \mat{cc}{ \alpha I & A^T \\ A & 0 }\f]
  is formed and factorized for some small \f$\alpha > 0\f$ using the
  GALAHAD package SLS---the
  factors \f$K = P L D L^T P^T\f$ are used to determine
  whether \f$A\f$ has dependent rows. In particular, in exact arithmetic
  dependencies in \f$A\f$ will correspond to zero pivots in the block
  diagonal matrix \f$D\f$.

  The second choice of method finds factors
  \f$A = P L U Q\f$ of the rectangular matrix \f$A\f$
  using the GALAHAD package ULS.
  In this case, dependencies in \f$A\f$ will be reflected in zero diagonal
  entries in \f$U\f$ in exact arithmetic.

  The factorization in either case may also be used to
  determine whether the system is consistent.

  \subsection fdc_call_order Call order

  To solve a given problem, functions from the fdc package must be called
  in the following order:

  - \link fdc_initialize \endlink - provide default control parameters and
      set up initial data structures
  - \link fdc_read_specfile \endlink (optional) - override control values
      by reading replacement values from a file
  - \link fdc_find_dependent_rows \endlink - find the number of dependent
      rows and, if there are any, whether the constraints are
      independent
  - \link fdc_terminate \endlink - deallocate data structures

  \latexonly
  See Section~\ref{examples} for examples of use.
  \endlatexonly
  \htmlonly
  See the <a href="examples.html">examples tab</a> for illustrations of use.
  \endhtmlonly
  \manonly
  See the examples section for illustrations of use.
  \endmanonly

  \subsection fdc_array_indexing Array indexing

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; add 1 to input integer arrays if fortran-style indexing is
  used, and beware that return integer arrays will adhere to this.
