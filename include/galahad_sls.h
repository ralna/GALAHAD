  \section sls_intro Introduction

  \subsection sls_purpose Purpose

  This package
  <b> solves dense or sparse symmetric systems of linear equations</b>
  using variants of Gaussian elimination.  Given a sparse symmetric
  \f$n \times n\f$ matrix \f$A\f$, and an \f$n\f$-vector \f$b\f$, this
  subroutine solves the system \f$A x = b\f$.  The matrix \f$A\f$ need not
  be definite.

  The package provides a common interface to a variety of well-known
  solvers from HSL and elsewhere. Currently supported solvers include
  \c MA27/SILS, \c HSL\_MA57, \c HSL\_MA77, \c HSL\_MA86,
  \c HSL\_MA87 and \c HSL\_MA97 from HSL,
  \c SSIDS from SPRAL,
  \c MUMPS from Mumps Technologies,
  \c PARDISO both from the Pardiso Project and Intel's MKL,
  \c PaStix from Inria
  and \c WSMP from the IBM alpha Works, as
  well as \c POTR, \c SYTR and \c SBTR from LAPACK.
  Note that
  <b> the solvers themselves do not form part of this package and
  must be obtained separately.</b>
  Dummy instances are provided for solvers that are unavailable.
  Also note that additional flexibility may be obtained by calling the
  solvers directly rather that via this package.

  \subsection sls_terminology Terminology

  The solvers used each produce an \f$L D L^T\f$ factorization of
  \f$A\f$ or a perturbation thereof, where \f$L\f$ is a permuted
  lower triangular matrix and \f$D\f$ is a block diagonal matrix with
  blocks of order 1 and 2. It is convenient to write this factorization in
  the form
  \f[A + E = P L D L^T P^T,\f] where
  \f$P\f$ is a permutation matrix and \f$E\f$ is any diagonal
  perturbation introduced.

  \subsection sls_method Method

Variants of sparse Gaussian elimination are used.

The solver \c SILS is available as part of GALAHAD and relies on
the HSL Archive package \c MA27. To obtain HSL Archive packages, see

http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/archive/ .

The solvers
\c HSL\_MA57,
\c HSL\_MA77,
\c HSL\_MA86,
\c HSL\_MA87
and
\c HSL\_MA97, the ordering packages
\c MC61 and \c HSL\_MC68, and the scaling packages
\c HSL\_MC64 and \c MC77
are all part of HSL 2011.
To obtain HSL 2011 packages, see

http://hsl.rl.ac.uk

The solver \c SSIDS is from the SPRAL sparse-matrix collection,
and is available as part of GALAHAD.

The solver \c MUMPS is available from Mumps Technologies in France, and 
version 5.5.1 or above is sufficient.
To obtain \c MUMPS, see

https://mumps-solver.org .

The solver \c PARDISO is available from the Pardiso Project;
version 4.0.0 or above is required.
To obtain \c PARDISO, see

http://www.pardiso-project.org/ .

The solver \c MKL PARDISO is available as part of Intel's oneAPI Math Kernel
Library (oneMKL).
To obtain this version of \c PARDISO, see

https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi.html .

The solver \c PaStix is available from Inria in France, and 
version 6.2 or above is sufficient.
To obtain \c PaStiX, see

https://solverstack.gitlabpages.inria.fr/pastix .

The solver \c WSMP is available from the IBM alpha Works;
version 10.9 or above is required.
To obtain \c WSMP, see

http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/wsmp .

The solvers \c POTR, \c SYTR and \c PBTR,
are available as
\c S/DPOTRF/S,
\c S/DSYTRF/S and \c S/DPBTRF/S
as part of LAPACK. Reference versions
are provided by GALAHAD, but for good performance
machined-tuned versions should be used.

Explicit sparsity re-orderings are obtained by calling the HSL package
\c HSL\_MC68.
Both this, \c HSL\_MA57 and \c PARDISO rely optionally
on the ordering package \c MeTiS (version 4) from the Karypis Lab.
To obtain \c METIS, see

http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/views/metis/ .

Bandwidth, Profile and wavefront reduction is supported by
calling HSL's \c MC61.

      parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved
  - \link sls_factorize_matrix \endlink - form and factorize the
      matrix \f$A\f$

  \subsection main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  The symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ coefficient matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.  Crucially symmetry
  is exploited  by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$A\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$A_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays row and
  col and real array val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array col, and real array val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

   \example slst.c
   This is an example of how to use the package in conjunction with the
   sparse linear solver \c sils.
   A variety of supported matrix storage formats are illustrated.

   Notice that C-style indexing is used, and that this is flaggeed by
   setting \c control.f_indexing to \c false.

    \example slstf.c
   This is the same example, but now fortran-style indexing is used.\n
