  \section bqp_intro Introduction

  \subsection bqp_purpose Purpose

  This package uses  a preconditioned, projected-gradient method
  to solve the <b>convex bound-constrained quadratic programming problem</b>
  \f[\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T H x + g^T x + f \f]
\manonly
  \n
  minimize q(x) := 1/2 x^T H x + g^T x + f
  \n
\endmanonly
  subject to the simple bound constraints
  \f[x_j^l  \leq  x_j \leq x_j^u, \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   x_j^l \[<=] x_j \[<=] x_j^u, j = 1, ... , n,
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ symmetric postive semi-definite matrix \f$H\f$,
  the vectors \f$g\f$, \f$x^l\f$, \f$x^u\f$ and the scalar \f$f\f$ are given.
  Any of the constraint bounds
  \f$x_j^l\f$ and \f$x_j^u\f$ may be infinite.
  Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix \f$H\f$;
  the matrix need not be provided as there are options to obtain matrix-vector
  products involving \f$H\f$ by reverse communication.

  \subsection bqp_terminology Terminology

  The required solution \f$x\f$ necessarily satisfies
  the primal optimality conditions
  \f[x^l \leq x \leq x^u,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   x^l \[<=] x \[<=] x^u,
  \n
\endmanonly
  the dual optimality conditions
  \f[H x + g = z\f]
\manonly
  \n
   H x + g = z
  \n
\endmanonly
  where
  \f[ z = z^l + z^u, \,\,
   z^l \geq 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\; z^u \leq 0,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   z = z^l + z^u, z^l \[>=] 0 and z^u \[<=] 0,
  \n
\endmanonly
  and the complementary slackness conditions
  \f[(x -x^l )^{T} z^l = 0 \;\;  \mbox{and} \;\; (x -x^u )^{T} z^u = 0,\hspace{12mm} \f]
\manonly
  \n
  (x -x^l)^T z^l = 0 and (x -x^u)^T z^u = 0,
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the vector \f$z\f$ is known as  the dual variables for the bounds,
  respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold component-wise.

  \subsection bqp_method Method

  The method is iterative. Each iteration proceeds in two stages.
  Firstly, the so-called generalized Cauchy point for the quadratic
  objective is found.  (The purpose of this point is to ensure that the
  algorithm converges and that the set of bounds which are satisfied as
  equations at the solution is rapidly identified.)  Thereafter an
  improvement to the objective is sought using either a
  direct-matrix or truncated conjugate-gradient algorithm.

  \subsection bqp_call_order Call order

  To solve a given problem, functions from the bqp package must be called
  in the following order:

  - \link bqp_initialize \endlink - provide default control parameters and
      set up initial data structures
  - \link bqp_read_specfile \endlink (optional) - override control values
      by reading replacement values from a file
  - set up problem data structures and fixed values by caling one of
     - \link bqp_import \endlink - in the case that \f$H\f$ is explicitly
        available
     - \link bqp_import_without_h \endlink - in the case that only the
        effect of applying \f$H\f$ to a vector is possible
  - \link bqp_reset_control \endlink (optional) - possibly change control
      parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved
  - solve the problem by calling one of
     - \link bqp_solve_given_h \endlink - solve the problem using values
          of \f$H\f$
     - \link bqp_solve_reverse_h_prod \endlink - solve the problem by returning
         to the caller for products of \f$H\f$ with specified vectors
  - \link bqp_information \endlink (optional) - recover information about
    the solution and solution process
  - \link bqp_terminate \endlink - deallocate data structures

  \subsection main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  If it is explicitly available, the symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$
  objective Hessian matrix \f$H\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry is exploited
  by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$H\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$H\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array H_val
  will hold the value \f$h_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$h_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$H\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$h_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays H_row and
  H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as H_ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$H\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = H_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_diagonal Diagonal storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is diagonal (i.e., \f$H_{ij} = 0\f$ for all
  \f$0 \leq i \neq j \leq n-1\f$) only the diagonals entries
  \f$H_{ii}\f$, \f$0 \leq i \leq n-1\f$ need
  be stored, and the first n components of the array H_val may be
  used for the purpose.

 @param[in,out] status is a scalar variable of type int, that gives
    the entry and exit status from the package. \n
    Possible exit are:
  \li  0. The run was succesful.

  \li -1. An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending
       array is written on unit control.error, and the returned allocation
       status and a string containing the name of the offending array
       are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
  \li -2. A deallocation error occurred.  A message indicating the offending
       array is written on unit control.error and the returned allocation
       status and a string containing the name of the offending array
       are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
  \li -3. The restriction n > 0 or requirement that a type contains
       its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate', 'sparse_by_rows' or
       'diagonal' has been violated.
  \li -4. The simple-bound constraints are inconsistent.
  \li -9. The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the return status
         from the factorization package is given in the component
         inform.factor_status
  \li -10. The factorization failed; the return status from the factorization
         package is given in the component inform.factor_status.
  \li -11. The solution of a set of linear equations using factors from the
         factorization package failed; the return status from the factorization
         package is given in the component inform.factor_status.
  \li -16. The problem is so ill-conditioned that further progress is
           impossible.
  \li -17. The step is too small to make further impact.
  \li -18. Too many iterations have been performed. This may happen if
         control.maxit is too small, but may also be symptomatic of
         a badly scaled problem.
  \li -19. The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen if
         control.cpu_time_limit is too small, but may also be symptomatic of
         a badly scaled problem.

  \li  2. The product \f$Hv\f$ of the Hessian \f$H\f$ with a given output
       vector \f$v\f$ is required from the user. The vector \f$v\f$ will be
       stored in v and the product \f$Hv\f$ must be returned in prod, and
       bqp_solve_reverse_h_prod re-entered with all other arguments unchanged.
  \li 3. The product \f$Hv\f$ of the Hessian H with a given output vector
       \f$v\f$ is required from the user. Only components
        nz_v[nz_v_start-1:nz_v_end-1]
       of the vector \f$v\f$ stored in v are nonzero. The resulting
       product \f$Hv\f$ must be placed in prod, and bqp_solve_reverse_h_prod
       re-entered with all other arguments unchanged.
  \li 4. The product \f$Hv\f$ of the Hessian H with a given output vector
       \f$v\f$ is required from the user. Only components
        nz_v[nz_v_start-1:nz_v_end-1]
       of the vector \f$v\f$  stored in v are nonzero. The resulting
       <b>nonzeros</b> in the product \f$Hv\f$ must be placed in their
       appropriate comnponents of prod, while a list of indices of the nonzeros
       placed in
         nz_prod[0 : nz_prod_end-1].
       bqp_solve_reverse_h_prod should then be re-entered with all other
       arguments unchanged. Typically v will be very sparse
       (i.e., nz_p_end-nz_p_start will be small).
