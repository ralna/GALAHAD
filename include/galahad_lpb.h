  \section lpb_intro Introduction

  \subsection lpb_purpose Purpose

  This package uses a primal-dual interior-point method
  to solve the <b>linear programming problem</b>
  \f[\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = g^T x + f \f]
\manonly
  \n
  minimize q(x) := g^T x + f
  \n
\endmanonly
  subject to the general linear constraints
  \f[c_i^l  \leq  a_i^Tx  \leq c_i^u, \;\;\; i = 1, \ldots , m,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   c_i^l \[<=] a_i^Tx \[<=] c_i^u, i = 1, ... , m,
  \n
\endmanonly
  and the simple bound constraints
  \f[x_j^l  \leq  x_j \leq x_j^u, \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   x_j^l \[<=] x_j \[<=] x_j^u, j = 1, ... , n,
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the vectors \f$g\f$, \f$w\f$, \f$x^{0}\f$,
  \f$a_i\f$, \f$c^l\f$, \f$c^u\f$, \f$x^l\f$,
  \f$x^u\f$ and the scalar \f$f\f$ are given.
  Any of the constraint bounds \f$c_i^l\f$, \f$c_i^u\f$,
  \f$x_j^l\f$ and \f$x_j^u\f$ may be infinite.
  Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix
  \f$A\f$ whose rows are the transposes of the vectors \f$a_i\f$.

  \subsection lpb_terminology Terminology

  The required solution \f$x\f$ necessarily satisfies
  the primal optimality conditions
  \f[\mbox{(1a) $\hspace{66mm} A x = c\hspace{66mm}$}\f]
\manonly
  \n
  (1a) A x = c
  \n
\endmanonly
  and
  \f[\mbox{(1b) $\hspace{52mm} c^l \leq c \leq c^u, \;\; x^l \leq x \leq x^u,\hspace{52mm}$} \f]
\manonly
  \n
  (1b) c^l \[<=] c \[<=] c^u, x^l \[<=] x \[<=] x^u,
  \n
\endmanonly
  the dual optimality conditions
  \f[\mbox{(2a) $\hspace{3mm} g = A^T y + z$}\f]
\manonly
  \n
  (2a) g = A^T y + z
  \n
\endmanonly
  where
  \f[\mbox{(2b) $\hspace{24mm} y = y^l + y^u, \;\; z = z^l + z^u, \,\,
   y^l \geq 0 , \;\;  y^u \leq 0 , \;\;
   z^l \geq 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\; z^u \leq 0,\hspace{24mm}$} \f]
\manonly
  \n
   (2b) y = y^l + y^u, z = z^l + z^u, y^l \[>=] 0, y^u \[<=] 0,
        z^l \[>=] 0 and z^u \[<=] 0,
  \n
\endmanonly
  and the complementary slackness conditions
  \f[\mbox{(3) $\hspace{12mm}
  ( A x - c^l )^T y^l = 0  ,\;\;  ( A x - c^u )^T y^u = 0  ,\;\;
  (x -x^l )^T z^l = 0 \;\;  \mbox{and} \;\; (x -x^u )^T z^u = 0,\hspace{12mm} $}\f]
\manonly
  \n
  (3) (A x - c^l)^T y^l = 0, (A x - c^u)^T y^u = 0,
      (x -x^l)^T z^l = 0 and (x -x^u)^T z^u = 0,
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the vectors \f$y\f$ and \f$z\f$ are
  known as the Lagrange multipliers for
  the general linear constraints, and the dual variables for the bounds,
  respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold component-wise.

  \subsection lpb_method Method

  Primal-dual interior point methods iterate towards a point
  that satisfies these conditions by ultimately aiming to satisfy
  (1a), (2a) and (3), while ensuring that (1b) and (2b) are
  satisfied as strict inequalities at each stage.  Appropriate norms of the
  amounts by  which (1a), (2a) and (3) fail to be satisfied are known as the
  primal and dual infeasibility, and the violation of complementary slackness,
  respectively. The fact that (1b) and (2b) are satisfied as strict
  inequalities gives such methods their other title, namely
  interior-point methods.

  The method aims at each stage to reduce the
  overall violation of (1a), (2a) and (3),
  rather than reducing each of the terms individually. Given an estimate
  \f$v = (x, c, y, y^l, y^u, z, z^l, z^u)\f$
  of the primal-dual variables, a correction
  \f$\Delta v = \Delta (x, c, y, y^l, y^u z, z^l, z^u)\f$
  is obtained by solving a suitable linear system of Newton equations for the
  nonlinear systems (1a), (2a) and a parameterized ``residual
  trajectory'' perturbation of (3); residual trajectories
  proposed by Zhang (1994) and Zhao and Sun (1999) are possibilities.
  An improved estimate \f$v + \alpha \Delta v\f$
  is then used, where the step-size \f$\alpha\f$
  is chosen as close to 1.0 as possible while ensuring both that
  (1b) and (2b) continue to hold and that the individual components
  which make up the complementary slackness
  (3) do not deviate too significantly
  from their average value. The parameter that controls the perturbation
  of (3) is ultimately driven to zero.

  The Newton equations are solved by applying the
  GALAHAD matrix factorization package SBLS, but there are options
  to factorize the matrix as a whole (the so-called "augmented system"
  approach), to perform a block elimination first (the "Schur-complement"
  approach), or to let the method itself decide which of the two
  previous options is more appropriate.
  The "Schur-complement" approach is usually to be preferred when all the
  weights are nonzero or when every variable is bounded (at least one side),
  but may be inefficient if any of the columns of \f$A\f$ is too dense.

  Optionally, the problem may be pre-processed temporarily to eliminate
  dependent constraints using the GALAHAD package FDC. This may
  improve the performance of the subsequent iteration.

  \subsection lpb_call_order Call order

  To solve a given problem, functions from the lpb package must be called
  in the following order:

  - \link lpb_initialize \endlink - provide default control parameters and
      set up initial data structures
  - \link lpb_read_specfile \endlink (optional) - override control values
      by reading replacement values from a file
  - \link lpb_import \endlink - set up problem data structures and fixed
      values
  - \link lpb_reset_control \endlink (optional) - possibly change control
      parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved
  - \link lpb_solve_lp \endlink - solve the linear program
  - \link lpb_information \endlink (optional) - recover information about
    the solution and solution process
  - \link lpb_terminate \endlink - deallocate data structures

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ constraint matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.
