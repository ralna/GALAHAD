  \section qpb_intro Introduction

  \subsection qpb_purpose Purpose

  This package uses a primal-dual interior-point trust-region method
  to solve the <b>quadratic programming problem</b>
  \f[\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T H x + g^T x + f \f]
\manonly
  \n
  minimize q(x) := 1/2 x^T H x + g^T x + f
  \n
\endmanonly
  subject to the general linear constraints
  \f[c_i^l  \leq  a_i^Tx  \leq c_i^u, \;\;\; i = 1, \ldots , m,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   c_i^l \[<=] a_i^Tx \[<=] c_i^u, i = 1, ... , m,
  \n
\endmanonly
  and the simple bound constraints
  \f[x_j^l  \leq  x_j \leq x_j^u, \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   x_j^l \[<=] x_j \[<=] x_j^u, j = 1, ... , n,
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ symmetric matrix \f$H\f$,
  the vectors \f$g\f$, \f$a_i\f$, \f$c^l\f$, \f$c^u\f$, \f$x^l\f$,
  \f$x^u\f$ and the scalar \f$f\f$ are given.
  Any of the constraint bounds \f$c_i^l\f$, \f$c_i^u\f$,
  \f$x_j^l\f$ and \f$x_j^u\f$ may be infinite.
  Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix \f$H\f$
  or the matrix \f$A\f$ of vectors \f$a_i\f$.

  If the matrix \f$H\f$ is positive semi-definite, a global
  solution is found. However, if \f$H\f$ is indefinite,
  the procedure may find a (weak second-order) critical point
  that is not the global solution to the given problem.

  The required solution \f$x\f$ necessarily satisfies

  for2 the general linear constraints, and the dual variables for the bounds,
  respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold component-wise.

  \subsection qpb_method Method

  Primal-dual interior point methods iterate towards a point
  that satisfies these conditions by ultimately aiming to satisfy
  (1a), (2a) and (3), while ensuring that (1b) and (2b) are
  satisfied as strict inequalities at each stage.  Appropriate norms of the
  amounts by  which (1a), (2a) and (3) fail to be satisfied are known as the
  primal and dual infeasibility, and the violation of complementary slackness,
  respectively. The fact that (1b) and (2b) are satisfied as strict
  inequalities gives such methods their other title, namely
  interior-point methods.

  The problem is solved in two phases. The goal of the first "initial
  feasible point" phase is to find a strictly interior point which is
  primal feasible, that is that {1a} is satisfied. The GALAHAD package
  LSQP is used for this purpose, and offers the options of either
  accepting the first strictly feasible point found, or preferably of
  aiming for the so-called "analytic center" of the feasible region.
  Having found such a suitable initial feasible point, the second
  "optimality" phase ensures that \req{4.1a} remains satisfied while
  iterating to satisfy dual feasibility (2a) and complementary
  slackness (3).  The optimality phase proceeds by approximately
  minimizing a sequence of barrier functions
\latexonly
  \[\frac{1}{2} x^T H x + g^T x + f -
   \mu \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log ( c_{i}  -  c_{i}^{l} )
   + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log ( c_{i}^{u}  -  c_{i} )
   + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \log ( x_{j}  -  x_{j}^{l} )
   + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \log ( x_{j}^{u}  -  x_{j} ) \right],\]
\endlatexonly
\htmlonly
  $$\frac{1}{2} x^T H x + g^T x + f -
   \mu \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log ( c_{i}  -  c_{i}^{l} )
   + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log ( c_{i}^{u}  -  c_{i} )
   + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \log ( x_{j}  -  x_{j}^{l} )
   + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \log ( x_{j}^{u}  -  x_{j} ) \right],$$
\endhtmlonly
\manonly
  \n
                  1/2 x^T H x + g^T x + f -
   mu [ sum_{i=1}^m log (c_i-c_i^l)  + sum_{i=1}^m log (c_i^u-c_i ) +
        sum_{j=1}^n log (x_j-x_j^l ) + sum_{j=1}^n log (x_j^u-x_j ) ]
  \n
\endmanonly
  for an approriate sequence of positive barrier parameters \f$\mu\f$
  converging to zero
  while ensuring that (1a) remain satisfied and that
  \f$x\f$ and \f$c\f$ are strictly interior points for (1b).
  Note that terms in the above sumations corresponding to infinite bounds are
  ignored, and that equality constraints are treated specially.

  Each of the barrier subproblems is solved using a trust-region method.
  Such a method generates a trial correction step \f$\Delta (x, c)\f$
  to the current iterate \f$(x, c)\f$ by replacing the nonlinear
  barrier function locally by a suitable quadratic model, and
  approximately minimizing this model in the intersection of \req{4.1a}
  and a trust region \f$\|\Delta (x, c)\| \leq \Delta\f$ for some
  appropriate strictly positive trust-region radius \f$\Delta\f$ and norm
  \f$\| \cdot \|\f$.  The step is accepted/rejected and the radius adjusted
  on the basis of how accurately the model reproduces the value of
  barrier function at the trial step. If the step proves to be
  unacceptable, a linesearch is performed along the step to obtain an
  acceptable new iterate. In practice, the natural primal "Newton" model
  of the barrier function is frequently less successful than an
  alternative primal-dual model, and consequently the primal-dual model
  is usually to be preferred.

  Once a barrier subproblem has been solved, extrapolation based on
  values and derivatives encountered on the central path is optionally
  used to determine a good starting point for the next subproblem.
  Traditional Taylor-series extrapolation has been superceded by more
  accurate Puiseux-series methods as these are particularly suited to
  deal with degeneracy.

  The trust-region subproblem is approximately solved using the combined
  conjugate-gradient/Lanczos method implemented in the GALAHAD package
  GLTR.  Such a method requires a suitable preconditioner, and in our
  case, the only flexibility we have is in approximating the model of
  the Hessian. Although using a fixed form of preconditioning is
  sometimes effective, we have provided the option of an automatic
  choice, that aims to balance the cost of applying the preconditioner
  against the needs for an accurate solution of the trust-region
  subproblem.  The preconditioner is applied using the GALAHAD matrix
  factorization package SBLS, but options at this stage are to factorize
  the preconditioner as a whole (the so-called "augmented system"
  approach), or to perform a block elimination first (the
  "Schur-complement" approach). The latter is usually to be prefered
  when a (non-singular) diagonal preconditioner is used, but may be
  inefficient if any of the columns of \f$A\f$ is too dense.

  In order to make the solution as efficient as possible, the variables
  and constraints are reordered internally by the GALAHAD package QPP
  prior to solution.  In particular, fixed variables, and free
  (unbounded on both sides) constraints are temporarily removed.

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ constraint matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsection main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  Likewise, the symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ objective Hessian matrix
  \f$H\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry is exploited
  by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$H\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$H\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array H_val
  will hold the value \f$h_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$h_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$H\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$h_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays H_row and
  H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as H_ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$H\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = H_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_diagonal Diagonal storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is diagonal (i.e., \f$H_{ij} = 0\f$ for all
  \f$0 \leq i \neq j \leq n-1\f$) only the diagonals entries
  \f$H_{ii}\f$, \f$0 \leq i \leq n-1\f$ need
  be stored, and the first n components of the array H_val may be
  used for the purpose.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_scaled_identity Multiples of the identity storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is a multiple of the identity matrix, (i.e., \f$H = \alpha I\f$
  where \f$I\f$ is the n by n identity matrix and \f$\alpha\f$ is a scalar),
  it suffices to store \f$\alpha\f$ as the first component of H_val.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_identity The identity matrix format

  If \f$H\f$ is the identity matrix, no values need be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_zero The zero matrix format

  The same is true if \f$H\f$ is the zero matrix.

   \example qpbt.c
   This is an example of how to use the package to solve a quadratic program.
   A variety of supported Hessian and constraint matrix storage formats are
   shown.

   Notice that C-style indexing is used, and that this is flaggeed by
   setting \c control.f_indexing to \c false.

    \example qpbtf.c
   This is the same example, but now fortran-style indexing is used.\n
