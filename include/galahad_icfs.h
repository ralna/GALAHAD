  \section icfs_intro Introduction

  \subsection icfs_purpose Purpose

  Given a symmetric matrix \f$\bmA\f$, this package
  <b> computes a symmetric, positive-definite approximation
  \f$\bmL \bmL^T\f$ using an incomplete Cholesky factorization</b>;
  the resulting matrix \f$\bmL\f$ is lower triangular.
  Subsequently, the solution \f$\bmx\f$ to the either of the linear systems
  \f$\bmL \bmx = \bmb\f$ and \f$\bmL^T \bmx = \bmb\f$
  may be found for a given vector \f$\bmb\f$.

       are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
  \li -3. The restriction n > 0 has been violated

 @param[in] n is a scalar variable of type int, that holds the number of
    rows in the symmetric matrix \f$A\f$.

 @param[in]  ptr is a one-dimensional array of size n+1 and type int,
   that holds the starting position of each column of the strictly
   lower triangular part of \f$A\f$ (i.e., \f$a_{i,j}\f$ for \f$i > j\f$),
   as well as the total number of entries plus one. The entries for
   column i will occur in positions matrix_ptr(i),...,matrix_ptr(i+1)-1 of
   the arrays matrix_row and matrix_val.

 @param[in] row is a one-dimensional array of size matrix_ptr(n+1)-1
   and type int, that holds the row indices of the strictly lower triangular
   part of \f$A\f$ as dictated by matrix_ptr.

 @param[in] diag is a one-dimensional array of size n and type double, that
   holds the values of the diagonals of \f$A\f$., i.e., matrix_diag(i) =
   \f$a_{i,i}\f$.

 @param[in] val is a one-dimensional array of size matrix_ptr(n+1)-1 and type
    double, that holds the values of the entries of  the strict lower
