  \section lpa_intro Introduction

  \subsection lpa_purpose Purpose

  This package uses the <b> simplex method</b>
  to solve the <b>linear programming problem</b>
  \f[\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = g^T x + f \f]
\manonly
  \n
  minimize q(x) := g^T x + f
  \n
\endmanonly
  subject to the general linear constraints
  \f[c_i^l  \leq  a_i^Tx  \leq c_i^u, \;\;\; i = 1, \ldots , m,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   c_i^l \[<=] a_i^Tx \[<=] c_i^u, i = 1, ... , m,
  \n
\endmanonly
  and the simple bound constraints
  \f[x_j^l  \leq  x_j \leq x_j^u, \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   x_j^l \[<=] x_j \[<=] x_j^u, j = 1, ... , n,
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the vectors \f$g\f$, \f$w\f$, \f$x^{0}\f$,
  \f$a_i\f$, \f$c^l\f$, \f$c^u\f$, \f$x^l\f$,
  \f$x^u\f$ and the scalar \f$f\f$ are given.
  Any of the constraint bounds \f$c_i^l\f$, \f$c_i^u\f$,
  \f$x_j^l\f$ and \f$x_j^u\f$ may be infinite.
  Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix
  \f$A\f$ whose rows are the transposes of the vectors \f$a_i\f$.

  <b>N.B.</b> The package is simply a sophisticated interface to the
  HSL package LA04, and requires that a user has obtained the latter.
  <b> LA04 is not included in GALAHAD</b>
  but is available without charge to recognised academics, see
  http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/catalogue/la04.html. If LA04
  is unavailable, the GALAHAD interior-point linear programming
  package LPB is an alternative.

  \subsection lpa_terminology Terminology

  The required solution \f$x\f$ necessarily satisfies
  the primal optimality conditions
  \f[\mbox{(1a) $\hspace{66mm} A x = c\hspace{66mm}$}\f]
\manonly
  \n
  (1a) A x = c
  \n
\endmanonly
  and
  \f[\mbox{(1b) $\hspace{52mm} c^l \leq c \leq c^u, \;\; x^l \leq x \leq x^u,\hspace{52mm}$} \f]
\manonly
  \n
  (1b) c^l \[<=] c \[<=] c^u, x^l \[<=] x \[<=] x^u,
  \n
\endmanonly
  the dual optimality conditions
  \f[\mbox{(2a) $\hspace{3mm} g = A^T y + z$}\f]
\manonly
  \n
  (2a) g = A^T y + z
  \n
\endmanonly
  where
  \f[\mbox{(2b) $\hspace{24mm} y = y^l + y^u, \;\; z = z^l + z^u, \,\,
   y^l \geq 0 , \;\;  y^u \leq 0 , \;\;
   z^l \geq 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\; z^u \leq 0,\hspace{24mm}$} \f]
\manonly
  \n
   (2b) y = y^l + y^u, z = z^l + z^u, y^l \[>=] 0, y^u \[<=] 0,
        z^l \[>=] 0 and z^u \[<=] 0,
  \n
\endmanonly
  and the complementary slackness conditions
  \f[\mbox{(3) $\hspace{12mm}
  ( A x - c^l )^T y^l = 0  ,\;\;  ( A x - c^u )^T y^u = 0  ,\;\;
  (x -x^l )^T z^l = 0 \;\;  \mbox{and} \;\; (x -x^u )^T z^u = 0,\hspace{12mm} $}\f]
\manonly
  \n
  (3) (A x - c^l)^T y^l = 0, (A x - c^u)^T y^u = 0,
      (x -x^l)^T z^l = 0 and (x -x^u)^T z^u = 0,
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the vectors \f$y\f$ and \f$z\f$ are
  known as the Lagrange multipliers for
  the general linear constraints, and the dual variables for the bounds,
  respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold component-wise.

  The so-called dual to this problem is another linear program
  \f[- \mbox{minimize} \;\; c^{lT} y^l + c^{uT} y^u + x^{lT} z^l + x^{uT} z^u + f \;\; \mbox{subject to the constraints (2a) and (2b)}\f]
\manonly
  \n
  - minimize c^{lT} y^l + c^{uT} y^u + x^{lT} z^l + x^{uT} z^u + f
  subject to the constraints (2a) and (2b)
  \n
\endmanonly
  that uses the same data. The solution to the two problems, it is exists,
  is the same, but if one is infeasible, the other is unbounded. It can be
  more efficient to solve the dual, particularly if \f$m\f$ is much larger
  than \f$n\f$.

  \subsection lpa_method Method

  The bulk of the work is peformed by the HSL package LA04. The
  main subbroutine from this package requires that the input problem
  be transformed into the ``standard form''
\latexonly
  \[  \begin{array}{rl}\mbox{minimize} & g^{\prime T} x^{\prime} \\(4)  \;\; \mbox{subject to} & A^{\prime} x^{\prime} = b \\ &  l_i \leq x^{\prime}_i \leq u_i, \;\;  (i\leq k) \\ \mbox{and} & x^{\prime}_l \geq 0, \;\; (i \geq l) \end{array} \]
\endlatexonly
\htmlonly
  \f[   \begin{array}{rl}\mbox{minimize} & g^{\prime T} x^{\prime} \\(4)  \;\; \mbox{subject to} & A^{\prime} x^{\prime} = b \\ &  l_i \leq x^{\prime}_i \leq u_i, \;\;  (i\leq k) \\ \mbox{and} & x^{\prime}_l \geq 0, \;\; (i \geq l) \end{array} \f]
\endhtmlonly
\manonly
  \n
         minimize g'^T x'
  (4)  subject to A' x' = b
                  l_i <= x'_i <= u_i, for i <= k
              and x'_l >= 0, for i >= l
  \n
\endmanonly
  by introducing slack an surpulus variables, reordering and
  removing fixed variables and free constraints. The resulting
  problem involves \f$n'\f$ unknowns and \f$m'\f$ general constraints.
  In order to deal with the possibility that the general constraints
  are inconsistent or not of full rank,
  LA04 introduces additional ``artifical'' variables \f$v\f$ and replaces
  the constraints of (4) by
  \f[(5) \;\; A' x' + v = b\f]
  and gradually encourages \f$v\f$ to zero as a first solution phase.

  Once a selection of \f$m'\f$ independent <b>non-basic</b> variables
  is made, the constraints (5) determine the remaining \f$m'\f$
  dependent <b>basic</b> variables. The <b>simplex method</b> is a
  scheme for systematically adjusting the choice of basic and non-basic
  variables until a set which defines an optimal solution of (4) is
  obtained. Each iteration of the simplex method requires the solution
  of a number of sets of linear equations whose coefficient matrix is
  the <b>basis</b> matrix \f$B\f$, made up of the columns of
  \f$[A'\f$  \f$I]\f$ corresponding to the basic variables, or its transpose
  \f$B^T\f$. As the basis matrices for consecutive iterations are
  closely related, it is normally advantageous to update (rather than
  recompute) their factorizations as the computation proceeds.  If an
  initial basis is not provided by the user, a set of basic variables
  which provide a (permuted) triangular basis matrix is found by the
  simple crash algorithm of Gould and Reid (1989), and initial
  steepest-edge weights are calculated.

  Phases one (finding a feasible solution) and two (solving (4)
  of the simplex method are applied, as appropriate, with the choice of
  entering variable as described by Goldfarb and Reid (1977) and the
  choice of leaving variable as proposed by Harris (1973).
  Refactorizations of the basis matrix are performed whenever doing so
  will reduce the average iteration time or there is insufficient memory
  for its factors.  The reduced cost for the entering variable is
  computed afresh. If it is found to be of a different sign from the
  recurred value or more than 10\% different in magnitude, a fresh
  computation of all the reduced costs is performed.  Details of the
  factorization and updating procedures are given by Reid (1982).
  Iterative refinement is encouraged for the basic solution and for the
  reduced costs after each factorization of the basis matrix and when
  they are recomputed at the end of phase 1.

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ constraint matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

    Possible exit are:
  \li  0. The run was succesful.

  \li -1. An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending
       array is written on unit control.error, and the returned allocation
       status and a string containing the name of the offending array
       are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
  \li -2. A deallocation error occurred.  A message indicating the offending
       array is written on unit control.error and the returned allocation
       status and a string containing the name of the offending array
       are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
  \li -3. The restrictions n > 0 and m > 0 or requirement that A_type contains
       its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate' or 'sparse_by_rows'
        has been violated.
  \li -5. The simple-bound constraints are inconsistent.
  \li -7. The constraints appear to have no feasible point.
  \li -9. The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the return status
         from the factorization package is given in the component
         inform.factor_status
  \li -10. The factorization failed; the return status from the factorization
         package is given in the component inform.factor_status.
  \li -11. The solution of a set of linear equations using factors from the
         factorization package failed; the return status from the factorization
         package is given in the component inform.factor_status.
  \li -16. The problem is so ill-conditioned that further progress is
           impossible.
  \li -17. The step is too small to make further impact.
  \li -18. Too many iterations have been performed. This may happen if
         control.maxit is too small, but may also be symptomatic of
         a badly scaled problem.
  \li -19. The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen if
         control.cpu_time_limit is too small, but may also be symptomatic of
         a badly scaled problem.
