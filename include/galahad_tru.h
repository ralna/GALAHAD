  \section tru_intro Introduction

  \subsection tru_purpose Purpose

  The tru package uses a <b>trust-region method to find a (local)
  unconstrained minimizer of a differentiable objective function
  \f$\mathbf{f(x)}\f$ of many variables \f$\mathbf{x}\f$.</b>
  The method offers the choice of
  direct and iterative solution of the key trust-region subproblems, and
  is most suitable for large problems. First derivatives are required,
  and if second derivatives can be calculated, they will be exploited---if
  the product of second derivatives with a vector may be found, but
  not the derivatives themselves, that may also be exploited.

  \subsection tru_terminology Terminology

  The \e gradient \f$\nabla_x f(x)\f$ of \f$f(x)\f$ is the vector whose
  \f$i\f$-th component is \f$\partial f(x)/\partial x_i\f$.
  The \e Hessian \f$\nabla_{xx} f(x)\f$ of \f$f(x)\f$ is the symmetric matrix
  whose \f$i,j\f$-th entry is \f$\partial^2 f(x)/\partial x_i \partial x_j\f$.
  The Hessian is \e sparse if a significant and useful proportion of the
  entries are universally zero.

  \subsection tru_method Method

  A trust-region method is used. In this, an improvement to a current
  estimate of the required minimizer, \f$x_k\f$ is sought by computing a
  step \f$s_k\f$. The step is chosen to approximately minimize a model
  \f$m_k(s)\f$ of \f$f(x_k + s)\f$ within a trust region
  \f$\|s_k\| \leq \Delta_k\f$  for some specified positive
  "radius" \f$\Delta_k\f$. The quality of the
  resulting step \f$s_k\f$ is assessed by computing the "ratio"
  \f$(f(x_k) - f(x_k + s_k))/ (m_k(0) - m_k(s_k))\f$.
  The step is deemed to have succeeded if the ratio exceeds a given
  \f$\eta_s > 0\f$, and in this case \f$x_{k+1} = x_k + s_k\f$. Otherwise
  \f$x_{k+1} = x_k\f$, and the radius is reduced by powers of a given
  reduction factor until it is smaller than \f$\|s_k\|\f$. If the ratio is
  larger than  \f$\eta_v \geq \eta_d\f$, the radius will be increased so that
  it exceeds \f$\|s_k\|\f$ by a given increase factor. The method will
  terminate as soon as \f$\|\nabla_x f(x_k)\|\f$ is smaller than a
  specified value.

  Either linear or quadratic models \f$m_k(s)\f$ may be used. The former
  will be taken as the first two terms \f$f(x_k) + s^T \nabla_x f(x_k)\f$
  of a Taylor series about \f$x_k\f$, while the latter uses an
  approximation to the first three terms
  \f$f(x_k) + s^T \nabla_x f(x_k) + \frac{1}{2} s^T B_k s\f$,
  for which \f$B_k\f$ is a symmetric approximation to the Hessian
  \f$\nabla_{xx}f(x_k)\f$ ; possible approximations include the true Hessian,
  limited-memory secant and sparsity approximations and a scaled identity
  matrix. Normally a two-norm trust region will be used, but this may change
  if preconditioning is employed.

  An approximate minimizer of the model within the trust region
  is found using either a direct approach involving factorization or an
  iterative (conjugate-gradient/Lanczos) approach based on approximations
  to the required solution from a so-called Krlov subspace. The direct
  approach is based on the knowledge that the required solution
  satisfies the linear system of equations
  \f$(B_k + \lambda_k I) s_k = - \nabla_x f(x_k)\f$ involving a scalar
  Lagrange multiplier \f$\lambda_k\f$.
  This multiplier is found by uni-variate root finding, using a safeguarded
  Newton-like process, by the GALAHAD packages TRS or DPS
  (depending on the norm chosen). The iterative approach
  uses the GALAHAD package GLTR, and is best accelerated by preconditioning
  with good approximations to \f$B_k\f$ using GALAHAD's PSLS. The
  iterative approach has the advantage that only matrix-vector products
  \f$B_k v\f$ are required, and thus \f$B_k\f$ is not required explicitly.
  However when factorizations of \f$B_k\f$ are possible, the direct approach
  is often more efficient.

  \section tru_call_order Call order

  To solve a given problem, functions from the tru package must be called
  in the following order:

  - \link tru_initialize \endlink - provide default control parameters and
      set up initial data structures
  - \link tru_read_specfile \endlink (optional) - override control values
      by reading replacement values from a file
  - \link tru_import \endlink - set up problem data structures and fixed
      values
  - \link tru_reset_control \endlink (optional) - possibly change control
      parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved
  - solve the problem by calling one of
     - \link tru_solve_with_mat \endlink - solve using function calls to
       evaluate function, gradient and Hessian values
     - \link tru_solve_without_mat \endlink - solve using function calls to
       evaluate function and gradient values and Hessian-vector products
     - \link tru_solve_reverse_with_mat \endlink - solve returning to the
       calling program to obtain function, gradient and Hessian values, or
     - \link tru_solve_reverse_without_mat \endlink - solve returning to the
       calling prorgram to obtain function and gradient values and
       Hessian-vector products

  \section main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  The symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ matrix \f$H = \nabla_{xx}f\f$ may be
  presented and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry
  is exploited by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$H\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$H\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$H_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array H_val
  will hold the value \f$H_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$H_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$H\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$H_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays H_row and
  H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as H_ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$H\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$H_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = H_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

         preconditioner \f$P(x)\f$ at the point x indicated in \f$x\f$ with
         the vector \f$v\f$ and then re-enter the function. The vector \f$v\f$
         is given in v, the resulting vector \f$u = P(x)v\f$ should be set in
         u and eval_status should be set to 0. If the user is unable to
         evaluate the product--- for instance, if a component of the
         preconditioner is undefined at \f$x\f$ --- the user need not set u,
         but should then set eval_status to a non-zero value.

 @param[in,out] data holds private internal data

 @param[in,out] status is a scalar variable of type int, that gives
    the entry and exit status from the package. \n
    On initial entry, status must be set to 1. \n
    Possible exit are:
  \li  0. The run was succesful

  \li -1. An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending
       array is written on unit control.error, and the returned allocation
       status and a string containing the name of the offending array
       are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
  \li -2. A deallocation error occurred.  A message indicating the offending
       array is written on unit control.error and the returned allocation
       status and a string containing the name of the offending array
       are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
  \li -3. The restriction n > 0 or requirement that type contains
       its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate', 'sparse_by_rows',
       'diagonal' or 'absent' has been violated.
  \li -7. The objective function appears to be unbounded from below
  \li -9. The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the return status
         from the factorization package is given in the component
         inform.factor_status
  \li -10. The factorization failed; the return status from the factorization
         package is given in the component inform.factor_status.
  \li -11. The solution of a set of linear equations using factors from the
         factorization package failed; the return status from the factorization
         package is given in the component inform.factor_status.
  \li -16. The problem is so ill-conditioned that further progress is
           impossible.
  \li -18. Too many iterations have been performed. This may happen if
         control.maxit is too small, but may also be symptomatic of
         a badly scaled problem.
  \li -19. The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen if
         control.cpu_time_limit is too small, but may also be symptomatic of
         a badly scaled problem.
  \li -82. The user has forced termination of solver by removing the file
         named control.alive_file from unit unit control.alive_unit.

 @param status (continued)
  \li  2. The user should compute the objective function value \f$f(x)\f$ at
         the point \f$x\f$ indicated in x and then re-enter the function.
         The required value should be set in f, and eval_status should be
         set to 0. If the user is unable to evaluate \f$f(x)\f$ --- for
         instance, if the function is undefined at \f$x\f$ --- the user need
         not set f, but should then set eval_status to a non-zero value.
  \li   3. The user should compute the gradient of the objective function
         \f$\nabla_x f(x)\f$ at the point \f$x\f$ indicated in x and then
         re-enter the function. The value of the i-th component of the g
         radient should be set in g[i], for i = 0, ..., n-1 and eval_status
         should be set to 0. If the user is unable to evaluate a component
         of \f$\nabla_x f(x)\f$ --- for instance if a component of the gradient
         is undefined at \f$x\f$ -the user need not set g, but should then set
         eval_status to a non-zero value.
  \li   5. The user should compute the product \f$\nabla_{xx}f(x)v\f$ of the
         Hessian of the objective function \f$\nabla_{xx}f(x)\f$ at the point
         \f$x\f$ indicated in x with the vector \f$v\f$, add the result to
         the vector \f$u\f$ and then re-enter the function. The vectors
         \f$u\f$ and \f$v\f$ are given in u and v respectively, the resulting
         vector \f$u + \nabla_{xx}f(x)v\f$ should be set
         in u and eval_status should be set to 0. If the user is unable to
         evaluate the product--- for instance, if a component of the Hessian is
         undefined at \f$x\f$ --- the user need not alter u, but should then set
         eval_status to a non-zero value.
  \li   6. The user should compute the product \f$u = P(x)v\f$ of their
         preconditioner \f$P(x)\f$ at the point x indicated in \f$x\f$ with
         the vector \f$v\f$ and then re-enter the function. The vector \f$v\f$
         is given in v, the resulting vector \f$u = P(x)v\f$ should be set in
         u and eval_status should be set to 0. If the user is unable to
         evaluate the product--- for instance, if a component of the
         preconditioner is undefined at \f$x\f$ --- the user need not set u,
         but should then set eval_status to a non-zero value.

   This is an example of how to use the package both when the Hessian
   is directly available and when its product with vectors may be found.
   Both function call evaluations and returns to the calling program
   to find the required values are illustrated. A variety of supported
   Hessian storage formats are shown.

   Notice that C-style indexing is used, and that this is flaggeed by
   setting \c control.f_indexing to \c false. In addition, see how
   parameters may be passed into the evaluation functions via \c userdata.\n

   \example trutf.c
   This is the same example, but now fortran-style indexing is used.\n
