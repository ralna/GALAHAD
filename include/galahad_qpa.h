  \section qpa_intro Introduction

  \subsection qpa_purpose Purpose

This package uses a working-set method
to solve the <b>\f$\ell_1\f$ quadratic programming problem</b>
\latexonly
  \[
   (1)\;\;\minin{x \in \smallRe^n} q(x) + \rho_g v_g(x) +\rho_b v_b(x)
  \]
\endlatexonly
\htmlonly
  $$
(1)\;\;\min_{x \in R^n} q(x) + \rho_g v_g(x) +\rho_b v_b(x)
  $$
\endhtmlonly
\manonly
  \n
  (1)   min_{x in R^n} q(x) + rho_g v_g(x) + rho_b v_b(x)
  \n
\endmanonly
involving the quadratic objective
\latexonly
  \[
  q(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T H x + g^T x + f
  \]
\endlatexonly
\htmlonly
  $$
  q(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T H x + g^T x + f
  $$
\endhtmlonly
\manonly
  \n
  q(x) = 1/2 x^T H x + g^T x + f
  \n
\endmanonly
and the infeasibilities
\latexonly
  \[
v_g(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \max ( c_i^l - a_i^T x, 0 ) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \max ( a_i^T x - c_i^u, 0 )
  \]
\endlatexonly
\htmlonly
  $$
v_g(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \max ( c_i^l - a_i^T x, 0 ) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \max ( a_i^T x - c_i^u, 0 )
  $$
\endhtmlonly
\manonly
  \n
   v_g(x) = sum_{i=1}^m max(c_i^l - a_i^T x, 0) +
            sum_{i=1}^m max(a_i^T x - c_i^u, 0)
  \n
\endmanonly
and
\latexonly
  \[
v_b(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \max ( x_j^l - x_j, 0 )
 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \max ( x_j  - x_j^u , 0 ),
  \]
\endlatexonly
\htmlonly
  $$
v_b(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \max ( x_j^l - x_j, 0 )
 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \max ( x_j  - x_j^u , 0 ),
  $$
\endhtmlonly
\manonly
  \n
   v_b(x) = sum_{j=1}^{n} max(x_j^l - x_j, 0) +
            sum_{j=1}^{n} max(x_j - x_j^u, 0),
  \n
\endmanonly
  where the \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ symmetric matrix \f$H\f$,
  the vectors \f$g\f$, \f$a_i\f$, \f$c^l\f$, \f$c^u\f$, \f$x^l\f$,
  \f$x^u\f$ and the scalar \f$f\f$ are given.
  Any of the constraint bounds \f$c_i^l\f$, \f$c_i^u\f$,
  \f$x_j^l\f$ and \f$x_j^u\f$ may be infinite.
  Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix \f$H\f$
  or the matrix \f$A\f$ of vectors \f$a_i\f$.

  The package may also be used to solve the <b>quadratic programming problem</b>
  \f[(2) \;\; \mbox{minimize}\;\; q(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T H x + g^T x + f \f]
\manonly
  \n
  (2)   minimize q(x) := 1/2 x^T H x + g^T x + f
  \n
\endmanonly
  subject to the general linear constraints
  \f[(3) \;\; c_i^l  \leq  a_i^Tx  \leq c_i^u, \;\;\; i = 1, \ldots , m,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   (3)  c_i^l \[<=] a_i^Tx \[<=] c_i^u, i = 1, ... , m,
  \n
\endmanonly
  and the simple bound constraints
  \f[(4) \;\; x_j^l  \leq  x_j \leq x_j^u, \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,\f]
\manonly
  \n
   (4)   x_j^l \[<=] x_j \[<=] x_j^u, j = 1, ... , n,
  \n
\endmanonly
  by automatically adjusting \f$\rho_b\f$ in (1).

  Similarly, the package is capable of solving the
  <b>bound-constrained \f$\ell_1\f$ quadratic programming problem</b>
\latexonly
  \[
  (5) \;\; \minin{x \in \smallRe^n} q(x) + \rho_g v_g(x),
  \]
\endlatexonly
\htmlonly
  $$
  (5) \;\; \min{x \in R^n} q(x) + \rho_g v_g(x),
  $$
\endhtmlonly

\manonly
  \n
  (5) min_{x in R^n} q(x) + rho_g v_g(x),
  \n
\endmanonly
  subject to the simple bound constraints (4),
  by automatically adjusting \f$\rho_b\f$ in (1).

  If the matrix \f$H\f$ is positive semi-definite, a global
  solution is found. However, if \f$H\f$ is indefinite,
  the procedure may find a (weak second-order) critical point
  that is not the global solution to the given problem.

  <b>N.B.</b> In many cases, the alternative GALAHAD quadratic
  programming package QPB is faster, and thus to be preferred.

  \subsection qpb_method Method

  At the \f$k\f$-th iteration of the method, an improvement to the value
  of the merit function
  \f$m(x, \rho_g, \rho_b ) = q(x) + \rho_g v_g(x) + \rho_b v_b(x)\f$ at
  \f$x = x^{(k)}\f$ is sought. This is achieved by
  first computing a search direction \f$s^{(k)}\f$, and then setting
  \f$x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + \alpha^{(k)} s^{(k)}\f$, where the stepsize
  \f$\alpha^{(k)}\f$ is chosen as the first local minimizer of
  \f$\phi(\alpha) = m( x^{(k)} + \alpha s^{(k)} , \rho_g, \rho_b )\f$ as
  \f$\alpha\f$ incesases from zero.  The stepsize calculation is
  straightforward, and exploits the fact that \f$\phi ( \alpha )\f$ is a
  piecewise quadratic function of \f$\alpha\f$.

  The search direction is defined by a subset of the "active" terms in
  \f$v(x)\f$, i.e., those for which \f$a_i^T x = c_i^l\f$ or \f$c_i^u\f$
  (for \f$i=1,\ldots ,m\f$) or \f$x_j = x_j^l\f$ or \f$x_j^u\f$ (for
  {j=1,\ldots ,n}).  The "working" set \f$W^{(k)}\f$ is chosen from the
  active terms, and is such that its members have linearly independent
  gradients.  The search direction \f$s^{(k)}\f$ is chosen as an
  approximate solution of the equality-constrained quadratic program

\endmanonly
  The equality-constrained quadratic program (6)-(7) is
  solved by a projected preconditioned conjugate gradient method. The
  method terminates either after a prespecified number of iterations, or
  if the solution is found, or if a direction of infinite descent, along which
  \f$q(x^{(k)} + s) + \rho_g l_g^{(k)} (s) + \rho_b l_b^{(k)} (s)\f$
  decreases without bound within the feasible region
  (7), is located.  Succesively more accurate approximations are
  required as suspected solutions of (1) are approached.

  Preconditioning of the conjugate gradient iteration
  requires the solution of one or more linear systems of the form
\latexonly
  \[
  (8)\;\; \mat{cc}{M^{(k)} & A^{(k)T} \\ A^{(k)} & 0 }
  \vect{ p \\ u} = \vect{ g \\ 0 },
  \]
\endlatexonly
\htmlonly
  $$
  (8) \begin{pmatrix} M^{(k)} & A^{(k)T} \\ A^{(k)} & 0 \end{pmatrix}
      \begin{pmatrix} p \\ u \end{pmatrix} =
      \begin{pmatrix} g \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
  $$
\endhtmlonly
\manonly
  \n
  (8) ( M^{(k)} A^{(k)T} ) ( p ) = ( g )
      ( A^{(k)}    0     ) ( u )   ( 0 )
  \n
\endmanonly
  where \f$M^{(k)}\f$ is a "suitable" approximation to \f$H\f$ and the
  rows of \f$A^{(k)}\f$ comprise the gradients of the terms in the
  current working set. Rather than recomputing a factorization of the
  preconditioner at every iteration, a Schur complement method is used,
  recognising the fact that gradual changes occur to successive working
  sets. The main iteration is divided into a sequence of "major"
  iterations.  At the start of each major iteration (say, the overall
  iteration \f$l\f$), a factorization of the current "reference" matrix,
  that is the matrix
\latexonly
  \[
  (9)\;\; \mat{cc}{M^{(l)} & A^{(l)T} \\ A^{(l)} & 0 }
  \]
\endlatexonly
\htmlonly
  $$
  (9) \begin{pmatrix} M^{(l)} & A^{(l)T} \\ A^{(l)} & 0 \end{pmatrix}
  $$
\endhtmlonly
\manonly
  \n
   (9) ( M^{(l)}   A^{(l)T} )
       ( A^{(l)}      0 }   )
  \n
\endmanonly
  is obtained using the GALAHAD matrix factorization package SLS.
  This reference matrix may be factorized as a whole (the so-called
  "augmented system" approach), or by performing a block elimination first
  (the "Schur-complement" approach). The latter is usually to be preferred
  when a (non-singular) diagonal
  preconditioner is used, but may be inefficient if any of the columns
  of \f$A^{(l)}\f$ is too dense.
  Subsequent iterations within the current major
  iteration obtain solutions to (8) via the factors of (9)
  and an appropriate (dense) Schur complement,
  obtained from the GALAHAD package SCU.
  The major iteration terminates
  once the space required to hold the factors of the (growing) Schur
  complement exceeds a given threshold.

  The working set changes by (a) adding an active term encountered
  during the determination of the stepsize, or (b) the removal of a term
  if \f$s = 0\f$ solves (6)-(7). The decision on which to
  remove in the latter case is based upon the expected decrease upon the
  removal of an individual term, and this information is available from
  the magnitude and sign of the components of the auxiliary vector
  \f$u\f$ computed in (8). At optimality, the components of \f$u\f$
  for \f$a_i\f$ terms will all lie between \f$0\f$ and \f$\rho_g\f$---and those
  for the other terms between \f$0\f$ and \f$\rho_b\f$---and any violation of
  this rule indicates further progress is possible. The components of
  \f$u\f$ corresonding to the terms involving \f$a_i^T x\f$ are
  sometimes known as Lagrange multipliers (or generalized gradients) and
  denoted by \f$y\f$, while those for the remaining \f$x_j\f$ terms are dual
  variables and denoted by \f$z\f$.

  To solve (2)-(4), a sequence of problems of the form
  (1) are solved, each with a larger value of \f$\rho_g\f$ and/or
  \f$\rho_b\f$ than its predecessor. The required solution has been found
  once the infeasibilities \f$v_g(x)\f$ and \f$v_b(x)\f$ have been reduced
  to zero at the solution of (1) for the given \f$\rho_g\f$ and
  \f$\rho_b\f$.

  In order to make the solution as efficient as possible, the variables
  and constraints are reordered internally by the GALAHAD package QPP
  prior to solution.  In particular, fixed variables and free (unbounded
  on both sides) constraints are temporarily removed.

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ constraint matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsection main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  Likewise, the symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ objective Hessian matrix
  \f$H\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry is exploited
  by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$H\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$H\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array H_val
  will hold the value \f$h_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$h_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$H\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$h_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays H_row and
  H_col and real array H_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as H_ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$H\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$h_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = H_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_diagonal Diagonal storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is diagonal (i.e., \f$H_{ij} = 0\f$ for all
  \f$0 \leq i \neq j \leq n-1\f$) only the diagonals entries
  \f$H_{ii}\f$, \f$0 \leq i \leq n-1\f$ need
  be stored, and the first n components of the array H_val may be
  used for the purpose.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_scaled_identity Multiples of the identity storage format

  If \f$H\f$ is a multiple of the identity matrix, (i.e., \f$H = \alpha I\f$
  where \f$I\f$ is the n by n identity matrix and \f$\alpha\f$ is a scalar),
  it suffices to store \f$\alpha\f$ as the first component of H_val.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_identity The identity matrix format

  If \f$H\f$ is the identity matrix, no values need be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_zero The zero matrix format

  The same is true if \f$H\f$ is the zero matrix.
