  \section gls_intro Introduction

  \subsection gls_purpose Purpose

  This package <b>solves sparse unsymmetric system of linear equations.</b>. 
  Given an \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ sparse matrix \f$A = a_{ij}\f$, the package
  solves the system \f$A x = b\f$ (or optionally \f$A^T x = b\f$).
  The matrix \f$A\f$ can be rectangular. 

  <b>N.B.</b> The package is simply a sophisticated interface to the 
  HSL package MA33, and requires that a user has obtained the latter.
  <b> MA33 is not included in GALAHAD</b>
  but is available without charge to recognised academics, see
  https://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/archive/specs/ma33.pdf .
  The package offers additional features to MA33.
  The storage required for the factorization is chosen
  automatically and, if there is insufficient space for the factorization,
  more space is allocated and the factorization is repeated.  The package
  also returns the number of entries in the factors and has facilities
  for identifying the rows and columns that are treated specially 
  when the matrix is singular or rectangular.

  Currently, only the control and inform parameters are exposed;
  these are provided and used by other GALAHAD packages with C interfaces.
  Extended functionality is available using the GALAHAD package uls.

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$  matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries plus one.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.
