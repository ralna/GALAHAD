/*! \mainpage GALAHAD C package convert

  \section convert_intro Introduction

  \subsection convert_purpose Purpose

  Given a real matrix \f$A\f$ stored in one format, convert it to another

  Currently, only the control and inform parameters are exposed;
  these are provided and used by other GALAHAD packages with C interfaces.

  \subsection convert_authors Authors

  N. I. M. Gould, STFC-Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, England.

  C interface, additionally J. Fowkes, STFC-Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.

  Julia interface, additionally A. Montoison and D. Orban, Polytechnique Montr√©al.

  \subsection convert_date Originally released

  June 2014, C interface February 2022.
