  \section llst_intro Introduction

  \subsection llst_purpose Purpose

  Given a real \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ matrix \f$A\f$,
  a real \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ symmetric diagonally dominant matrix \f$S\f$
  a real \f$m\f$ vector \f$b\f$ and a scalar \f$\Delta>0\f$, this package 
  finds a <b> minimizer of the linear least-squares objective function
  \f$\| A x  - b \|_2\f$, where the vector \f$x\f$ is
  required to satisfy the constraint \f$\|x\|_S \leq  \Delta\f$,</b>
  where the \f$S\f$-norm of \f$x\f$ is 
  \f$\|x\|_S = \sqrt{x^T S x}\f$.
  This problem commonly occurs as a trust-region subproblem in nonlinear
  least-squares calculations. The package may also be used to solve the 
  related problem in which \f$x\f$ is  instead required to satisfy the
  <b>equality constraint \f$\|x\|_{S} = \Delta\f$</b>.
  The matrix \f$S\f$ need not be provided in the commonly-occurring
  \f$\ell_2\f$-trust-region case for which \f$S = I\f$, 
  the \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$   identity matrix.

  Factorization of matrices of the form
  \f[\mbox{(1)}\;\;\; K(\lambda) = \mat{cc}{ \lambda S & A^T \\ A & - I}\f]
\manonly
\n
    (1)     K(lambda) = ( lambda S   A^T )
                        (      A     - I )
\n
\endmanonly
  of scalars \f$\lambda\f$ will be required, so this package is most suited
  for the case where such a factorization may be found efficiently. If
  this is not the case, the GALAHAD package \c LSTR may be preferred.

  \subsection llst_terminology Terminology

  The required solution \f$x_*\f$ necessarily satisfies the 
  optimality condition \f$A^T A x_* + \lambda_* S x_* = A^T b\f$,
  where \f$\lambda_* \geq 0\f$ is a Lagrange
  multiplier corresponding to the constraint \f$\|x\|_S  \leq  \Delta\f$;
  for the equality-constrained problem \f$\|x\|_S = \Delta\f$ and
  the multiplier is unconstrained.

  \subsection llst_method Method

  The method is iterative, and proceeds in two phases.  Firstly,
  lower and upper bounds, \f$\lambda_L\f$ and
  \f$\lambda_U\f$, on \f$\lambda_*\f$ are computed using
  Gershgorin's theorems and other eigenvalue bounds, including those that 
  may involve the Cholesky factorization of \f$S\f$. The first phase of
  the computation proceeds by progressively shrinking the bound interval
  \f$[\lambda_L,\lambda_U]\f$
  until a value \f$\lambda\f$ for which \f$\|x(\lambda)\|_M \geq \Delta\f$
  is found.  Here \f$x(\lambda)\f$ and its companion \f$y(\lambda)\f$ are
  defined to be a solution of
\manonly
  \f[\mbox{(2)}\;\;\; 
  (A^T A  + \lambda S)x(\lambda) = A^T b;\f]
\n
   (2)    (A^T A  + \lambda S)x(\lambda) = A^T b;
\n
\endmanonly
  along the way the possibility that \f$\|x(0)\|_M \leq \Delta\f$ is examined, 
  and if this transpires the process is terminated with \f$x_* = x(0)\f$.
  Once the terminating \f$\lambda\f$ from the first phase has
  been discovered, the second phase consists of applying Newton or
  higher-order iterations to the nonlinear ``secular'' equation
  \f$\|x(\lambda)\|_M = \Delta\f$ with the knowledge that such
  iterations are both globally and ultimately rapidly convergent. 

  The dominant cost is the requirement that we solve a sequence of linear
  systems (2). This may be rewritten as
  \f[\mbox{(3)}\;\;\; \mat{cc}{ \lambda S & A^T \\ A & - I}
  \vect{x(\lambda) \\ y(\lambda)} = \vect{ A^T b \\ 0}\f]
\manonly
\n
    (3)     ( lambda S   A^T ) ( x(lambda) ) = ( A^T b )
            (      A     - I ) ( y(lambda) )   (   0   )
\n
\endmanonly
  for some auxiliary vector \f$y(\lambda)\f$.
  In general a sparse symmetric, indefinite factorization of the
  coefficient matrix \f$K(\lambda)\f$ of (3) is often preferred to a 
  Cholesky factorization of that of (2).

  \subsection llst_references Reference

  The method is the obvious adaptation to the linear least-squares
  problem of that described in detail in

  \subsection main_unsymmetric_matrices Unsymmetric matrix storage formats

  The unsymmetric \f$m\f$ by \f$n\f$ constraint matrix \f$A\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of convenient input formats.

  Both C-style (0 based)  and fortran-style (1-based) indexing is allowed.
  Choose \c control.f_indexing as \c false for C style and \c true for
  fortran style; the discussion below presumes C style, but add 1 to
  indices for the corresponding fortran version.

  Wrappers will automatically convert between 0-based (C) and 1-based
  (fortran) array indexing, so may be used transparently from C. This
  conversion involves both time and memory overheads that may be avoided
  by supplying data that is already stored using 1-based indexing.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$A\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  In this case, component \f$n \ast i + j\f$  of the storage array A_val
  will hold the value \f$A_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$A\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$A_{ij}\f$,
  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,  \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays A_row and
  A_col and real array A_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as A_ne = \f$ne\f$.

  \subsubsection unsymmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$A\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq n-1\f$, and values
  \f$A_{ij}\f$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = A_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  \f$0 \leq i \leq m-1\f$,
  of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsection main_symmetric_matrices Symmetric matrix storage formats

  Likewise, the non-trivial symmetric \f$n\f$ by \f$n\f$ scaling matrix
  \f$S\f$ may be presented
  and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry is exploited
  by only storing values from the lower triangular part
  (i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_dense Dense storage format

  The matrix \f$S\f$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that is,
  the values of the entries of each row in turn are
  stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
  Since \f$S\f$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
  \f$s_{ij}\f$ for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$) need be held.
  In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
  component \f$i \ast i / 2 + j\f$  of the storage array S_val
  will hold the value \f$s_{ij}\f$ (and, by symmetry, \f$s_{ji}\f$)
  for \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_coordinate Sparse co-ordinate storage format

  Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
  For the \f$l\f$-th entry, \f$0 \leq l \leq ne-1\f$, of \f$S\f$,
  its row index i, column index j
  and value \f$s_{ij}\f$, \f$0 \leq j \leq i \leq n-1\f$,  are stored as
  the \f$l\f$-th components of the integer arrays S_row and
  S_col and real array S_val, respectively, while the number of nonzeros
  is recorded as S_ne = \f$ne\f$.
  Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_row_wise Sparse row-wise storage format

  Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
  they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
  in row i+1. For the i-th row of \f$S\f$ the i-th component of the
  integer array S_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
  while S_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries.
  The column indices j, \f$0 \leq j \leq i\f$, and values
  \f$s_{ij}\f$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
  l = S_ptr(i), \f$\ldots\f$, S_ptr(i+1)-1 of the
  integer array S_col, and real array S_val, respectively.
  Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
  For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
  its predecessor.

  \subsubsection symmetric_matrix_diagonal Diagonal storage format

  If \f$S\f$ is diagonal (i.e., \f$s_{ij} = 0\f$ for all
  \f$0 \leq i \neq j \leq n-1\f$) only the diagonals entries
  \f$s_{ii}\f$, \f$0 \leq i \leq n-1\f$ need
  be stored, and the first n components of the array S_val may be
  used for the purpose.

  paramters for the remaining prcedures (see llst_control_type)

 @param[in,out] data holds private internal data

 @param[in,out] status is a scalar variable of type int, that gives
    the exit status from the package. Possible values are:
  \li  1. The import was succesful, and the package is ready for the solve phase
  \li -1. An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the 
       offending array is written on unit control.error, and the 
       returned allocation status and a string containing the name 
       of the offending array are held in inform.alloc_status and 
       inform.bad_alloc respectively.
  \li -2. A deallocation error occurred.  A message indicating the 
       offending array is written on unit control.error and the 
       returned allocation status and a string containing the
       name of the offending array are held in 
       inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
  \li -3. The restriction n > 0 or requirement that type contains
       its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate', 'sparse_by_rows' or
       'diagonal' has been violated.

 @param[in] n is a scalar variable of type int, that holds the number of
    variables, i.e., the number of rows and columns of \f$S\f$. 
    n must be positive.

 @param[in]  S_type is a one-dimensional array of type char that specifies the
   \link main_symmetris_matrices symmetric storage scheme \endlink
   used for the matrix \f$S\f$. It should be one of 'coordinate',
   'sparse_by_rows', 'dense' or 'diagonal'; lower or upper
   case variants are allowed.

 @param[in]  S_ne is a scalar variable of type int, that holds the number of
   entries in the lower triangular part of \f$S\f$ in the sparse co-ordinate
   storage scheme. It need not be set for any of the other schemes.

 @param[in]  S_row is a one-dimensional array of size S_ne and type int, that
   holds the row indices of the lower triangular part of \f$S\f$ in the sparse
   co-ordinate storage scheme. It need not be set for any of the other
   three schemes, and in this case can be NULL.

 @param[in]  S_col is a one-dimensional array of size S_ne and type int,
   that holds the column indices of the lower triangular part of \f$S\f$ in
   either the sparse co-ordinate, or the sparse row-wise storage scheme. It
   need not be set when the dense, diagonal or (scaled) identity storage
   schemes are used,  and in this case can be NULL.

 @param[in]  S_ptr is a one-dimensional array of size n+1 and type int,
   that holds the starting position of  each row of the lower
   triangular part of \f$S\f$, as well as the total number of entries,
   in the sparse row-wise storage scheme. It need not be set when the
   other schemes are used, and in this case can be NULL.

 @param[in,out] status is a scalar variable of type int, that gives
    the entry and exit status from the package. \n
    Possible exit are:
  \li  0. The run was succesful.

  \li -1. An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending
       array is written on unit control.error, and the returned allocation
       status and a string containing the name of the offending array
       are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
  \li -2. A deallocation error occurred.  A message indicating the offending
       array is written on unit control.error and the returned allocation
       status and a string containing the name of the offending array
       are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
  \li -3. The restrictions n > 0 and m > 0 or requirement that A_type or
       A_type contains its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate', 
       'sparse_by_rows' or 'diagonal' has been violated.
  \li -9. The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the return status
         from the factorization package is given in the component
         inform.factor_status
  \li -10. The factorization failed; the return status from the factorization
         package is given in the component inform.factor_status.
  \li -11. The solution of a set of linear equations using factors from the
         factorization package failed; the return status from the factorization
         package is given in the component inform.factor_status.
  \li -15. The matrix \f$S\f$ does not appear to be strictly diagonally 
           dominant.
  \li -16. The problem is so ill-conditioned that further progress is
           impossible.
  \li -17. The step is too small to make further impact.
