  \section sha_intro Introduction

  \subsection sha_purpose Purpose

  Find a <b>component-wise secant approximation to the Hessian matrix</b>
  \f$H(x)\f$, for which \f$(H(x))_{i,j} = \partial f^2 (x) / \partial x_i \partial x_j\f$,
  \f$1 \leq i, j \leq n\f$, using values of the gradient \f$g(x) = \nabla_x f(x)\f$
  of the function \f$f(x)\f$ of \f$n\f$ unknowns \f$x = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)^T\f$
  at a sequence of given distinct \f${x^{(k)}}\f$, \f$k \geq 0\f$.
  More specifically, given <b>differences</b>
  \f[s^{(k)} = x^{(k+1)} - x^{(k)}\f]
\manonly
  \n
  s^(k) = x^(k+1) - x^(k)
  \n
\endmanonly
  and
  \f[y^{(k)} = g(x^{(k+1)}) - g(x^{(k)}) \f]
\manonly
  \n
  y^(k) = g(x^(k+1)) - g(x^(k))
  \n
\endmanonly
  the package aims to find a good estimate \f$B\f$ of \f$H(x)\f$ for
  which the secant conditions \f$B s^{(k)} = y^{(k)}\f$ hold
  approximately for a chosen set of values \f$k\f$.
  The methods provided take advantage of the entries in the Hessian that
  are known to be zero.

  The package is particularly intended to allow gradient-based
  optimization methods, that generate iterates
  \f$x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + s^{(k)}\f$ based upon the values \f$g( x^{(k)})\f$
  for \f$k \geq 0\f$, to build a suitable approximation to the Hessian
  \f$H(x^{(k+1)})\f$. This then gives the method an opportunity to
  accelerate the iteration using the Hessian approximation.

  \subsection sha_method Method

  The package computes the entries in the each row of \f$B\f$ one at a time.
  The entries \f$b_{ij}\f$ in row \f$i\f$ may be chosen to
  \f[(1) \;\;\; \minin{b_{i,j}} \;\; \sum_{k \in {\cal I}_i}
  \left[ \sum_{{\scriptscriptstyle \mbox{nonzeros}}\; j}
  b_{i,j} s_j^{(k)} - y_i^{(k)} \right]^2,
  \f]
\manonly
  \n
  (1)  min_{b_{i,j}} sum_{k \in I_i}
                   [ sum_{nonzeros j} b_{i,j} s_j^(k) - y_i^(k) ]^2
  \n
\endmanonly
  where \f$I_i\f$ is ideally chosen to be sufficiently large so that
  (1) has a unique minimizer. Since this requires that there are at least
  as many \f$(s^{(k)}, y^{(k)})\f$ pairs as the maximum number of nonzeros
  in any row, this may be prohibitive in some cases. We might then be content
  with a minimum-norm (under-determined) least-squares solution. Or, we may
  take advantage of the symmetry of the Hessian, and note that if we
  have already found the values in row \f$j\f$, then the value
  \f$b_{i,j} = b_{j,i}\f$
  in (1) is known before we process row \f$i\f$. Thus by ordering the rows
  and exploiting symmetry we may reduce the numbers of unknowns in
  future unprocessed rows.

  In the analysis phase, we order the rows by constructing the connectivity
  graph---a graph comprising nodes \f$1\f$ to \f$n\f$ and edges connecting
  nodes \f$i\f$ and \f$j\f$ if \f$h_{i,j}\f$ is everywhere nonzero---of
  \f$H(x)\f$.
  The nodes are ordered by increasing degree (that is, the number of edges
  emanating from the node) using a bucket sort. The row chosen to be
  ordered next corresponds to a node of minimum degree, the node
  is removed from the graph, the degrees updated efficiently, and the
  process repeated until all rows have been ordered. This often leads
  to a significant reduction in the numbers of unknown values in each
  row as it is processed in turn, but numerical rounding can lead to
  inaccurate values in some cases. A useful remedy is to process all
  rows for which there are sufficient \f$(s^{(k)}, y^{(k)})\f$ as before,
  and then process the remaining rows taking into account the symmetry.
  That is, the rows and columns are rearranged so that the matrix
  is in block form
  \f[B = \mat{cc}{ B_{11} & B_{12} \\ B^T_{12} & B_{22}},\f]
\manonly
  \n
  B = (  B_11  B_12 ),
      ( B_12^T B_22 )
  \n
\endmanonly
  the \f$( B_{11} \;\; B_{12})\f$ rows are processed without regard
  for symmetry but give the \f$2,1\f$ block \f$B^T_{12}\f$, and finally
  the \f$2,2\f$ block \f$B_{22}\f$ is processed either
  with the option of exploiting
  symmetry. More details of the precise algorithms (Algorithms 2.1--2.5)
  are given in the reference below. The linear least-squares problems (1)
  themselves are solved by a choice of LAPACK packages.

  \subsection sha_call_order Call order

  To find the Hessian approximation, functions from the sha package
  must be called in the following order:

  - \link sha_initialize \endlink - provide default control parameters and
      set up initial data structures
  - \link sha_read_specfile \endlink (optional) - override control values
      by reading replacement values from a file
  - \link sha_analyse_matrix \endlink - set up structures needed to
      construct the Hessian approximation
  - \link sha_recover_matrix \endlink - construct the Hessian approximation
  - \link sha_information \endlink (optional) - recover information about
    the solution and solution process
  - \link sha_terminate \endlink - deallocate data structures
