.. module:: galahad.wcp

The ``wcp`` package uses a **primal-dual interior-point method** to find a 
well-centered point within a **polyhedral set**.
The aim is to find a point that lies interior to the boundary of the 
polyhedron definied by the general linear constraints and simple bounds
$$c_l \leq A x \leq c_u \;\;\mbox{and} \;\; x_l \leq x \leq x_u,$$
where $A$ is a given $m$ by $n$ matrix, and any of the components 
of the vectors $c_l$, $c_u$, $x_l$ or $x_u$ may be infinite.
The method offers the choice of direct and iterative solution of the key
regularization subproblems, and is most suitable for problems
involving a large number of unknowns $x$, since full advantage is taken of
"any zero coefficients in the matrix $A$.
The package identifies infeasible problems, and problems for which there is 
no strict interior.

See Section 4 of $GALAHAD/doc/wcp.pdf for a brief description of the
method employed and other details.

matrix storage
--------------

The **unsymmetric** $m$ by $n$ matrix $A$ may be presented
and stored in a variety of convenient input formats. 

*Dense* storage format:
The matrix $A$ is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is,
the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
In this case, component $n \ast i + j$  of the storage array A_val
will hold the value $A_{ij}$ for $0 \leq i \leq m-1$, $0 \leq j \leq n-1$.
The string A_type = 'dense' should be specified.

*Dense by columns* storage format:
The matrix $A$ is stored as a compact dense matrix by columns, that is,
the values of the entries of each column in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
In this case, component $m \ast j + i$  of the storage array A_val
will hold the value $A_{ij}$ for $0 \leq i \leq m-1$, $0 \leq j \leq n-1$.
The string A_type = 'dense_by_columns' should be specified.

*Sparse co-ordinate* storage format:
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
For the $l$-th entry, $0 \leq l \leq ne-1$, of $A$,
its row index i, column index j and value $A_{ij}$,
$0 \leq i \leq m-1$,  $0 \leq j \leq n-1$,  are stored as the $l$-th 
components of the integer arrays A_row and A_col and real array A_val, 
respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as A_ne = $ne$.
The string A_type = 'coordinate'should be specified.

*Sparse row-wise storage* format:
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
in row i+1. For the i-th row of $A$ the i-th component of the
integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries.
The column indices j, $0 \leq j \leq n-1$, and values
$A_{ij}$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
l = A_ptr(i), $\ldots$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  $0 \leq i \leq m-1$,
of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
its predecessor.
The string A_type = 'sparse_by_rows' should be specified.

*Sparse column-wise* storage format:
Once again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in column j appear directly before those
in column j+1. For the j-th column of $A$ the j-th component of the
integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this column,
while A_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries.
The row indices i, $0 \leq i \leq m-1$, and values $A_{ij}$
of the  nonzero entries in the j-th columnsare stored in components
l = A_ptr(j), $\ldots$, A_ptr(j+1)-1, $0 \leq j \leq n-1$,
of the integer array A_row, and real array A_val, respectively.
As before, for sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less
storage than the co-ordinate format.
The string A_type = 'sparse_by_columns' should be specified.

          status : int
            return status.  Possible values are:

            * **0**

              The run was succesful.

            * **-1**

              An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the
              offending array is written on unit control['error'], and
              the returned allocation status and a string containing
              the name of the offending array are held in
              inform['alloc_status'] and inform['bad_alloc'] respectively.

            * **-2**

              A deallocation error occurred.  A message indicating the
              offending array is written on unit control['error'] and
              the returned allocation status and a string containing
              the name of the offending array are held in
              inform['alloc_status'] and inform['bad_alloc'] respectively.

            * **-3**

              The restriction n > 0 or m > 0 or requirement that type contains
              its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate' or 'sparse_by_rows'
              has been violated.

            * **-4**

              The constraint bounds are inconsistent.

            * **-5**

              The constraints appear to have no feasible point.

            * **-9**

              The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the return
              status from the factorization package is given by
              inform['factor_status'].

            * **-10**

              The factorization failed; the return status from the
              factorization package is given by inform['factor_status'].

            * **-11**

              The solution of a set of linear equations using factors
              from the factorization package failed; the return status
              from the factorization package is given by
              inform['factor_status'].

            * **-16**

              The problem is so ill-conditioned that further progress
              is impossible.

            * **-17**

               The step is too small to make further impact.

            * **-18**

              Too many iterations have been performed. This may happen if
              control['maxit'] is too small, but may also be symptomatic
              of a badly scaled problem.

            * **-19**

              The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen if
              control['cpu_time_limit'] is too small, but may also be
              symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
