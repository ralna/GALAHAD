-------

The ``rpd`` package **reads and writes** quadratic programming
(and related) problem data to and from a QPLIB-format data file.
Variables may be continuous, binary or integer.

**Currently only the options and inform dictionaries are exposed**; these are 
provided and used by other GALAHAD packages with Python interfaces.
Please contact us if you would like full functionality!

See Section 4 of $GALAHAD/doc/rpd.pdf for additional details.
