The ``convert`` package takes a sparse matrix $A$ stored in one format and 
**converts** it into another.

**Currently only the options and inform dictionaries are exposed**; these are 
provided and used by other GALAHAD packages with Python interfaces.
Please contact us if you would like full functionality!

See Section 4 of $GALAHAD/doc/convert.pdf for a brief description of the
method employed and other details.
