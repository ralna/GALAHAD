The ``fit`` package **fits polynomials to function and derivative data**.

provided and used by other GALAHAD packages with Python interfaces.
Please contact us if you would like full functionality!

See Section 4 of $GALAHAD/doc/fit.pdf for a brief description of the
method employed and other details.
