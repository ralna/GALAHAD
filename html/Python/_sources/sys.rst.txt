**Release:** 1.0

**Date:** |today|

**Author:** `Jaroslav Fowkes <jaroslav.fowkes@stfc.ac.uk>`_ and `Nick Gould <nick.gould@stfc.ac.uk>`_

GALAHAD [1]_ is a suite of open-source routines for large-scale continuous
optimization.  Currently there are seven packages designed to provide 
preconditioners and solve linear systems of equations.
