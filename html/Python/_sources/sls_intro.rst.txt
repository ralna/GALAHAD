purpose
-------

The ``sls`` package 
**solves dense or sparse symmetric systems of linear equations**
using variants of Gaussian elimination.
Given a sparse symmetric matrix $A = \{ a_{ij} \}_{n \times n}$, and an
$n$-vector $b$ or a matrix $B = \{ b_{ij} \}_{n \times r}$, this
function solves the system $A x = b$ or the system $A X = B$ . 
The matrix $A$ need not be definite.

The method provides a common interface to a variety of well-known
solvers from HSL and elsewhere. Currently supported solvers include
``MA27/SILS``, ``HSL_MA57``, ``HSL_MA77`` , ``HSL_MA86``,
``HSL_MA87`` and ``HSL_MA97`` from {HSL},
``SSIDS`` from {SPRAL},
``MUMPS`` from Mumps Technologies,
``PARDISO`` both from the Pardiso Project and Intel's MKL,
``PaStiX`` from Inria, and
``WSMP`` from the IBM alpha Works, 
as well as ``POTR``, ``SYTR`` and ``SBTR`` from LAPACK.
Note that, with the exception of ``SSIDS`` and the Netlib
reference LAPACK codes,
**the solvers themselves do not form part of this package and
must be obtained/linked to separately.**
Dummy instances are provided for solvers that are unavailable.
Also note that additional flexibility may be obtained by calling the
solvers directly rather that via this package.

terminology
-----------

The solvers used each produce an $L D L^T$ factorization of
$A$ or a perturbation thereof, where $L$ is a permuted
lower triangular matrix and $D$ is a block diagonal matrix with
blocks of order 1 and 2. It is convenient to write this factorization in
the form
$$A + E = P L D L^T P^T,$$
where $P$ is a permutation matrix and $E$ is any diagonal
perturbation introduced.

method
------

Variants of sparse Gaussian elimination are used.
See Section 4 of $GALAHAD/doc/sls.pdf for a brief description of the
method employed and other details.

The solver ``SILS`` is available as part of GALAHAD and relies on
the HSL Archive package ``MA27``. To obtain HSL Archive packages, see

- http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/archive/ .

The solvers
``HSL_MA57``,
``HSL_MA77``,
``HSL_MA86``,
``HSL_MA87``
and
``HSL_MA97``, the ordering packages
``MC61`` and ``HSL_MC68``, and the scaling packages
``HSL_MC64`` and ``MC77``
are all part of HSL 2011.
To obtain HSL 2011 packages, see

- http://hsl.rl.ac.uk .

The solver ``SSIDS`` is from the SPRAL sparse-matrix collection,
and is available as part of GALAHAD.

The solver ``MUMPS`` is available from Mumps Technologies in France, and 
version 5.5.1 or above is sufficient.
To obtain ``MUMPS``, see

- https://mumps-solver.org .

The solver ``PARDISO`` is available from the Pardiso Project;
version 4.0.0 or above is required.
To obtain ``PARDISO``, see

- http://www.pardiso-project.org/ .

The solver ``MKL PARDISO`` is available as part of Intel's oneAPI Math Kernel
Library (oneMKL).
To obtain this version of ``PARDISO``, see

- https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi.html .

The solver ``PaStix`` is available from Inria in France, and 
version 6.2 or above is sufficient.
To obtain ``PaStiX``, see

- https://solverstack.gitlabpages.inria.fr/pastix .

The solver ``WSMP`` is available from the IBM alpha Works;
version 10.9 or above is required.
To obtain ``WSMP``, see

- http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/wsmp .

The solvers ``POTR``, ``SYTR`` and ``PBTR``,
are available as
``S/DPOTRF/S``,
``S/DSYTRF/S`` and ``S/DPBTRF/S``
as part of LAPACK. Reference versions
are provided by GALAHAD, but for good performance
machined-tuned versions should be used.

Explicit sparsity re-orderings are obtained by calling the HSL package
``HSL_MC68``.
Both this, ``HSL_MA57`` and ``PARDISO`` rely optionally
on the ordering package ``MeTiS`` (version 4) from the Karypis Lab.
To obtain ``METIS``, see

- http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/views/metis/ .

Bandwidth, Profile and wavefront reduction is supported by
calling HSL's ``MC61``.

The methods used are described in the user-documentation for

HSL 2011, A collection of Fortran codes for large-scale scientific computation (2011).
