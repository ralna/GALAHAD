matrix storage
--------------

The **unsymmetric** $m$ by $n$ matrix $A$ must be presented
and stored in *sparse row-wise storage* format.
For this, only the nonzero entries are stored, and they are
ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
in row i+1. For the i-th row of $A$ the i-th component of the
integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries.
The column indices j, $0 \leq j \leq n-1$, and values
$A_{ij}$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
l = A_ptr(i), $\ldots$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  $0 \leq i \leq m-1$,
of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
