   .. function:: ir.initialize()

      Set default option values and initialize private data.

      **Returns:**

      options : dict
        dictionary containing default control options:
          error : int
             error and warning diagnostics occur on stream error.
          out : int
             general output occurs on stream out.
          print_level : int
             controls level of diagnostic output.
          itref_max : int
             maximum number of iterative refinements allowed.
          acceptable_residual_relative : float
             refinement will cease as soon as the residual $\|Ax-b\|$
             falls below max( acceptable_residual_relative * $\|b\|$,
             acceptable_residual_absolute ).
          acceptable_residual_absolute : float
             see acceptable_residual_relative.
          required_residual_relative : float
             refinement will be judged to have failed if the residual
             $\|Ax-b\| \geq $ required_residual_relative * $\|b\|$. No
             checking if required_residual_relative < 0.
          record_residuals : bool
             record the initial and final residual.
          space_critical : bool
             if ``space_critical`` is True, every effort will be made to
             use as little space as possible. This may result in longer
             computation time.
          deallocate_error_fatal : bool
             if ``deallocate_error_fatal`` is True, any array/pointer
             deallocation error will terminate execution. Otherwise,
             computation will continue.
          prefix : str
            all output lines will be prefixed by the string contained
            in quotes within ``prefix``, e.g. 'word' (note the qutoes)
            will result in the prefix word.

   .. function:: [optional] ir.information()

      Provide optional output information.

      **Returns:**

      inform : dict
         dictionary containing output information:
          status : int
             the return status.  Possible values are:

             * **0**

               The insertion or deletion was succesful.

             * **-1**

               An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the
               offending array is written on unit options['error'], and
               the returned allocation status and a string containing
               the name of the offending array are held in
               inform['alloc_status'] and inform['bad_alloc'] respectively.

             * **-2**

               A deallocation error occurred.  A message indicating the
               offending array is written on unit options['error'] and
               the returned allocation status and a string containing
               the name of the offending array are held in
               inform['alloc_status'] and inform['bad_alloc'] respectively.

             * **-11**

               Iterative refinement has not reduced the relative residual by 
               more than options['required_relative_residual'].
          alloc_status : int
             the status of the last attempted allocation/deallocation.
          bad_alloc : str
             the name of the array for which an allocation/deallocation
             error occurred.
          norm_initial_residual : float
             the infinity norm of the initial residual.
          norm_final_residual : float
             the infinity norm of the final residual.

   .. function:: ir.finalize()

     Deallocate all internal private storage.
