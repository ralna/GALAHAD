   .. function:: [optional] dqp.information()

      Provide optional output information

      **Returns:**

      inform : dict
         dictionary containing output information:
          status : int
            return status.  Possible values are:

            * **0**

              The run was succesful.

            * **-1**

              An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the
              offending array is written on unit options['error'], and
              the returned allocation status and a string containing
              the name of the offending array are held in
              inform['alloc_status'] and inform['bad_alloc'] respectively.

            * **-2**

              A deallocation error occurred.  A message indicating the
              offending array is written on unit options['error'] and
              the returned allocation status and a string containing
              the name of the offending array are held in
              inform['alloc_status'] and inform['bad_alloc'] respectively.

            * **-3**

              The restriction n > 0 or m > 0 or requirement that type contains
              its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate', 'sparse_by_rows',
              'diagonal', 'scaled_identity',  'identity', 'zero' or 'none' 
              has been violated.

            * **-4**

              The bound constraints are inconsistent.

            * **-5**

              The constraints appear to have no feasible point.

            * **-9**

              The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the return
              status from the factorization package is given by
              inform['factor_status'].

            * **-10**

              The factorization failed; the return status from the
              factorization package is given by inform['factor_status'].

            * **-16**

              The problem is so ill-conditioned that further progress
              is impossible.

            * **-18**

              Too many iterations have been performed. This may happen if
              options['maxit'] is too small, but may also be symptomatic
              of a badly scaled problem.

            * **-19**

              The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen if
              options['cpu_time_limit'] is too small, but may also be
              symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.

            * **-20**

              The Hessian $H$ appears not to be positive definite.

            * **-23** 

              An entry from the strict upper triangle of $H$ has been 
              specified.
