		- status

		- 
		  is a scalar variable of type int, that gives the entry and exit status from the package.
		  
		  Possible exit are:
		  
		  * 0. The run was succesful.
		  
		  
		  
		  * -1. An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending array is written on unit control.error, and the returned allocation status and a string containing the name of the offending array are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * -2. A deallocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending array is written on unit control.error and the returned allocation status and a string containing the name of the offending array are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * -3. The restrictions n > 0 and m > 0 or requirement that A_type contains its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate' or 'sparse_by_rows' has been violated.
		  
		  * -5. The simple-bound constraints are inconsistent.
		  
		  * -7. The constraints appear to have no feasible point.
		  
		  * -9. The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the return status from the factorization package is given in the component inform.factor_status
