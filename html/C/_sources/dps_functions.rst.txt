Find the global minimizer of the regularized-quadartic problem (2) if some non-matrix components have changed since a call to dps_solve_rq_problem.



.. rubric:: Parameters:

.. list-table::
	:widths: 20 80

	*
		- data

		- holds private internal data

	*
		- status

		- 
		  is a scalar variable of type int, that gives the exit status from the package.
		  
		  Possible values are:
		  
		  * 0. The run was succesful
		  
		  
		  
		  * -1. An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending array is written on unit control.error, and the returned allocation status and a string containing the name of the offending array are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * -2. A deallocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending array is written on unit control.error and the returned allocation status and a string containing the name of the offending array are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * -16. The problem is so ill-conditioned that further progress is impossible.

	*
		- n

		- is a scalar variable of type int, that holds the number of variables

	*
		- c

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type double, that holds the linear term :math:`c` in the objective function. The j-th component of c, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains :math:`c_j`.

	*
		- f

		- is a scalar variable pointer of type double, that holds the value of the holds the constant term :math:`f` in the objective function.

	*
		- weight

		- is a scalar variable pointer of type double, that holds the value of the regularization weight, :math:`\sigma > 0`.

	*
		- power

		- is a scalar variable pointer of type double, that holds the value of the regularization power, :math:`p \geq 2`.

	*
		- x

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type double, that holds the values :math:`x` of the optimization variables. The j-th component of x, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains :math:`x_j`.
