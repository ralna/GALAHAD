Global Optimization
-------------------

**Release:** 1.0

**Date:** |today|

**Author:** `Jaroslav Fowkes <jaroslav.fowkes@stfc.ac.uk>`_ and `Nick Gould <nick.gould@stfc.ac.uk>`_

GALAHAD [1]_ is a suite of open-source routines for large-scale continuous
optimization.  Currently there are three packages designed to find global
optima, or at least good approximations to them.
