		  * 4. The product :math:`Hv` of the Hessian H with a given output vector :math:`v` is required from the user. Only components nz_v[nz_v_start-1:nz_v_end-1] of the vector :math:`v` stored in v are nonzero. The resulting **nonzeros** in the product :math:`Hv` must be placed in their appropriate comnponents of prod, while a list of indices of the nonzeros placed in nz_prod[0 : nz_prod_end-1]. bqp_solve_reverse_h_prod should then be re-entered with all other arguments unchanged. Typically v will be very sparse (i.e., nz_p_end-nz_p_start will be small).

		- n

		- is a scalar variable of type int, that holds the number of variables

	*
		- g

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type double, that holds the linear term :math:`g` of the objective function. The j-th component of g, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains :math:`g_j`.

	*
		- f

		- is a scalar of type double, that holds the constant term :math:`f` of the objective function.

	*
		- x_l

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type double, that holds the lower bounds :math:`x^l` on the variables :math:`x`. The j-th component of x_l, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains :math:`x^l_j`.

	*
		- x_u

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type double, that holds the upper bounds :math:`x^l` on the variables :math:`x`. The j-th component of x_u, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains :math:`x^l_j`.

	*
		- x

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type double, that holds the values :math:`x` of the optimization variables. The j-th component of x, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains :math:`x_j`.

	*
		- z

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type double, that holds the values :math:`z` of the dual variables. The j-th component of z, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains :math:`z_j`.

	*
		- x_stat

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type int, that gives the optimal status of the problem variables. If x_stat(j) is negative, the variable :math:`x_j` most likely lies on its lower bound, if it is positive, it lies on its upper bound, and if it is zero, it lies between its bounds.
