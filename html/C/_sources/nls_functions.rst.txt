	*
		- status

		- 
		  is a scalar variable of type int, that gives the exit status from the package. Possible values are:
		  
		  * 1. The import was succesful, and the package is ready for the solve phase
		  
		  * -1. An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending array is written on unit control.error, and the returned allocation status and a string containing the name of the offending array are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * -2. A deallocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending array is written on unit control.error and the returned allocation status and a string containing the name of the offending array are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * -3. The restrictions n > 0, m > 0 or requirement that J/H/P_type contains its relevant string 'dense', 'dense_by_columns', 'coordinate', 'sparse_by_rows', 'sparse_by_columns', 'diagonal' or 'absent' has been violated.

		  * 2. The user should compute the vector of residuals :math:`c(x)` at the point :math:`x` indicated in x and then re-enter the function. The required value should be set in c, and eval_status should be set to 0.

Find a local minimizer of a given function using a trust-region method.

This call is for the case where access to :math:`H = \nabla_{xx}f(x)` is provided by Hessian-vector products, but function/derivative information is only available by returning to the calling procedure.

	*
		- data

		- holds private internal data

	*
		- status

		- 
		  is a scalar variable of type int, that gives the entry and exit status from the package.
		  
		  On initial entry, status must be set to 1.
		  
		  Possible exit are:
		  
		  * 0. The run was succesful
		  
		  
		  
		  * -1. An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending array is written on unit control.error, and the returned allocation status and a string containing the name of the offending array are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * -2. A deallocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending array is written on unit control.error and the returned allocation status and a string containing the name of the offending array are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * -3. The restriction n > 0 or requirement that type contains its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate', 'sparse_by_rows', 'diagonal' or 'absent' has been violated.
		  
		  * -9. The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the return status from the factorization package is given in the component inform.factor_status

		  * -10. The factorization failed; the return status from the factorization package is given in the component inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * -11. The solution of a set of linear equations using factors from the factorization package failed; the return status from the factorization package is given in the component inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * -16. The problem is so ill-conditioned that further progress is impossible.
		  
		  
		  
		  * -17. The step is too small to make further impact.
		  
		  * -18. Too many iterations have been performed. This may happen if control.maxit is too small, but may also be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
		  
		  * -19. The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen if control.cpu_time_limit is too small, but may also be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
		  
		  * -82. The user has forced termination of solver by removing the file named control.alive_file from unit unit control.alive_unit.
		  
		  
		  
		  * 2. The user should compute the vector of residuals :math:`c(x)` at the point :math:`x` indicated in x and then re-enter the function. The required value should be set in c, and eval_status should be set to 0. If the user is unable to evaluate :math:`c(x)` for instance, if the function is undefined at :math:`x` the user need not set c, but should then set eval_status to a non-zero value.
		  
		  
		  
		  * 5. The user should compute the sum :math:`u + \nabla_{x}c_(x) v` (if tranpose is false) or :math:`u + (\nabla_{x}c_(x))^T v` (if tranpose is true) between the product of the Jacobian :math:`\nabla_{x}c_(x)` or its tranpose with the vector v= :math:`v` and the vector u = $ :math:`u`, and then re-enter the function. The result should be set in u, and eval_status should be set to 0. If the user is unable to evaluate the sum for instance, if the Jacobian is undefined at :math:`x` the user need not set u, but should then set eval_status to a non-zero value.
		  
		  
		  
		  * 6. The user should compute the sum :math:`u + \sum_{i=1}^m y_i \nabla_{xx}c_i(x) v` between the product of the weighted residual Hessian :math:`H = \sum_{i=1}^m y_i \nabla_{xx}c_i(x)` evaluated at x= :math:`x` and y= :math:`y` with the vector v= :math:`v` and the the vector u = $ :math:`u`, and then re-enter the function. The result should be set in u, and eval_status should be set to 0. If the user is unable to evaluate the sum for instance, if the weifghted residual Hessian is undefined at :math:`x` the user need not set u, but should then set eval_status to a non-zero value.
		  
		  
		  
		  * 7. The user should compute the entries of the matrix :math:`P`, whose i-th column is the product :math:`\nabla_{xx}c_i(x) v` between :math:`\nabla_{xx}c_i(x)`, the Hessian of the i-th component of the residual :math:`c(x)` at x= :math:`x`, and v= :math:`v` and then re-enter the function. The l-th component of the matrix stored according to the scheme specified for the remainder of :math:`P` in the earlier call to nls_import should be set in P_val[l], for l = 0, ..., P_ne-1 and eval_status should be set to 0. If the user is unable to evaluate a component of :math:`P` for instance, if a component of the matrix is undefined at :math:`x` the user need not set P_val, but should then set eval_status to a non-zero value. **Note** that this return will not happen if either the Gauss-Newton or Newton models is selected.
