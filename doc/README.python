   PYTHON interfaces to GALAHAD

   ----------------------------------
   N.B. ONLY TESTED WITH gcc/gfortran
   ----------------------------------

0. Add suitable PYVERSION, PYTHONINCLUDE, NUMPYINCLUDE,
   SOABI and PYSITEPACKDIR variables in each architecture 
   file (architecture), i.e. the names of files in $GALAHAD/makefiles

    PYTHONVERSION = x.yy where x is the main version (usually 3) and yy 
                      is the latest subversion (currently 10)
    PYTHONINCLUDE = location of python include files, often
                      /usr/include/python$(PYTHONVERSION)
    NUMPYINCLUDE  = location of numpy package inclues, often
                      /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/numpy/core/include
    SOABI         = SOABI/extension suffix, for example
                      cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu (Linux), or
                      cpython-310m-darwin (OSX).
                    This may be found by issuing the commands
                       import sysconfig
                       print(sysconfig.get_config_var('SOABI')
                    in python3
    PYSITEPACKDIR = location of local python site packages, often
                       ~/.local/lib/python$(PYTHONVERSION)/site-packages

   These variables are found and set automatically during the install 
   (if python 3 is present), but may be changed afterwards by editing the 
   file $GALAHAD/makefiles/(architecture)

1. Build fortran and C libraries as normal

     make -s -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/(architecture) all_ciface

    from $GALAHAD/src

2. Now build the Python interfaces

     make -s -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/(architecture) all_pyiface

3. Optionally, run simple tests to see if everything is ok

     make -s -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/(architecture) test_all_pyiface

   This may be done on a package-by-package basis, for example

     cd $GALAHAD/src/(package)
     make -s -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/(architecture) test_pyiface
    
   for the package (package)

4. Documentation is available via

     $GALAHAD/html/Python/index.html

   (best viewed in a browser with the suffix file:/// )
