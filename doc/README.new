LANCELOT B is an updated version of LANCELOT A; the latter is
documented in

  A. R. Conn, N. I. M. Gould and Ph. L. Toint,
  "LANCELOT: a Fortran package for large-scale nonlinear optimization",
  Springer Series in Computational Mathematics, vol. 17,
  Springer Verlag (Heidelberg, New York), 1992.

and described in

  A. R. Conn, N. I. M. Gould and Ph. L. Toint,
  "Numerical experiments with the LANCELOT package
  (Release A) for large-scale nonlinear optimization",
  Mathematical Programming, 73(1), 1996, pp 73-110.

LANCELOT B offers the following improvements over its predecessor:

 * coded in Fortran 90

   * automatic allocation of workspace
   * simplified calling sequences;

 * a non-monotone descent strategy to be used by default;

 * the optional use of More' & Toraldo -type projections during the
   subproblem solution phase;

 * an interface to Lin & More's public domain incomplete Cholesky
   factorization package ICFS for use as a preconditioner;

 * the optional use of structured trust regions to better model
   structured problems;

 * the provision of optional automatic differentiation to compute
   derivatives of problems supplied in SIF format (using John Reid's
   HSL package AD01 and/or its threadsafe successor AD02 when available);

 * SIF syntax slighty improved to allow for simpler input of
   quadratic programs.

Further minor changes include:

 *  calls to the HSL package MA31 have been replaced to calls to MA61,
    as MA31 has been superceded;

 *  calls to the scaling routine MC29 have been made unnecessary by
    the use of a GALAHAD scaling package.
