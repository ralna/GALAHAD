\realdp, that specifies the
fraction of the optimal value which is acceptable for the solution of the
inner iteration (search direction) problem using the package 
{\tt \libraryname\_GLTR}, 
and corresponds to the value {\tt control\%fraction\_opt} in that package.

that is used to specify the maximum permitted elapsed system clock time. 
Any negative value indicates no limit will be imposed. The default is 
{\tt clock\_time\_limit = - 1.0}.

\itt{remove\_dependencies} is a scalar variable of type 
default \logical, that must be set \true\ if the algorithm
is to attempt to remove any linearly dependent constraints before
solving the problem, and \false\ otherwise. 
We recommend removing linearly dependencies.
The default is {\tt remove\_dependencies = .TRUE.}.

\itt{treat\_zero\_bounds\_as\_general} is a scalar variable of type 
default \logical.
If it is set to \false, variables which 
are only bounded on one side, and whose bound is zero,
will be recognised as non-negativities/non-positivities rather than simply as
lower- or upper-bounded variables.
If it is set to \true, any variable bound 
$x_{j}^{l}$ or $x_{j}^{u}$ which has the value 0.0 will be
treated as if it had a general value.
Setting {\tt treat\_zero\_bounds\_as\_general} to \true\ has the advantage
that if a sequence of problems are reordered, then bounds which are
``accidentally'' zero will be considered to have the same structure as
those which are nonzero. However, {\tt \fullpackagename} is
able to take special advantage of non-negativities/non-positivities, so
if a single problem, or if a sequence of problems whose 
bound structure is known not to change, is/are to be solved, 
it will pay to set the variable to \false.
The default is {\tt treat\_zero\_bounds\_as\_general = .FALSE.}.

\itt{center} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that 
must be set \true\
if the algorithm will should use the analytic center

We recommend using the analytic center.
The default is {\tt center = .TRUE.}.

\itt{primal} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that 
must be set \true\
if a primal-barrier Hessian will be used
and \false\ if the primal-dual Hessian is preferred.
We recommend using the primal-dual Hessian.
The default is {\tt primal = .FALSE.}.

\itt{puiseux} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that 
must be set \true\
if a Puiseux series will be used when extrapolating along the central path
and \false\ if a Taylor series is preferred.
We recommend using the Puiseux series unless the solution is known
to be non-degenerate.
The default is {\tt puiseux = .TRUE.}.

\itt{feasol} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that 
should be set \true\ 
if the final solution obtained will be perturbed 
so that variables close to their bounds are moved onto these bounds,
and \false\ otherwise. 
The default is {\tt feasol = .FALSE.}.
%The default is {\tt feasol = .TRUE.}.

%\itt{array\_syntax\_worse\_than\_do\_loop} is a scalar variable of type 
%default \logical, that should be set \true\ if the compiler is
%better able to optimize Fortran 77-style do-loops than to exploit 
%Fortran 95-style array syntax when performing vector operations,
%and \false\ otherwise. 
%The default is {\tt array\_syntax\_worse\_than\_do\_loop = .FALSE.}.

\itt{prefix} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 30, that may be used to provide a user-selected 
character string to preface every line of printed output. 
Specifically, each line of output will be prefaced by the string 
{\tt prefix(2:LEN(TRIM(prefix))-1)},
thus ignoring the first and last non-null components of the
supplied string. If the user does not want to preface lines by such
a string, they may use the default {\tt prefix = ""}.

\itt{LSQP\_control} is a scalar variable of type 
{\tt LSQP\_control\_type}
whose components are used to control the initial feasible point calculation
performed by the package 
{\tt \libraryname\_LSQP}. 
See the specification sheet for the package 
{\tt \libraryname\_LSQP} 
for details, and appropriate default values (but note that default value for 
{\tt LSQP\_control\%feasol} is changed to \false.

\itt{FDC\_control} is a scalar variable of type 
{\tt FDC\_control\_type}
whose components are used to control any detection of linear dependencies
performed by the package 
{\tt \libraryname\_FDC}. 
See the specification sheet for the package 
{\tt \libraryname\_FDC} 
for details, and appropriate default values.

\itt{SBLS\_control} is a scalar variable of type 
{\tt SBLS\_control\_type}
whose components are used to control preconditioning, needed to accelerate
the step calculation, 
performed by the package 
{\tt \libraryname\_SBLS}. 
See the specification sheet for the package 
{\tt \libraryname\_SBLS} 
for details, and appropriate default values (but note that if
{\tt SBLS\_control\%preconditioner = 5}, the diagonal matrix used is
corresponds to replacing the Hesian matrix by its barrier terms).

\itt{GLTR\_control} is a scalar variable of type 
{\tt GLTR\_control\_type}
whose components are used to control the step calculation
performed by the package 
{\tt \libraryname\_GLTR}.

for details, and appropriate default values.
