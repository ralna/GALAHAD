%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary
This package uses an primal-dual interior-point trust-region method
to solve the {\bf quadratic programming problem}
\disp{\mbox{minimize}\;\; \half \bmx^T \bmH \bmx + \bmg^T \bmx + f}
subject to the general linear constraints
\disp{c_{i}^{l}  \leq  \bma_{i}^{T}\bmx  \leq  c_{i}^{u}, \;\;\;
 i = 1, \ldots , m,}
and the simple bound constraints
\disp{x_{j}^{l}  \leq  x_{j}^{ } \leq  x_{j}^{u} , \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,}
where the $n$ by $n$ symmetric matrix $\bmH$, the 
vectors $\bmg$, $\bma_{i}$, $\bmc^{l}$, $\bmc^{u}$, $\bmx^{l}$, 
$\bmx^{u}$ and the scalar $f$ are given.
Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix $\bmH$ or the
vectors $\bma_{i}$. 
Any of the constraint bounds $c_{i}^{l}$, $c_{i}^{u}$, 
$x_{j}^{l}$ and $x_{j}^{u}$ may be infinite.

If the matrix $\bmH$ is positive semi-definite, a global
solution is found. However, if $\bmH$ is indefinite,
the procedure may find  a (weak second-order) critical point 
that is not the global solution to the given problem.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% matrix formats %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmatrix
Both the Hessian matrix $\bmH$ and
the constraint Jacobian $\bmA$, the matrix 
whose rows are the vectors $\bma_{i}^{T}$, $i = 1, \ldots , m$, 
may be stored in a variety of input formats.

\subsubsection{Dense storage format}\label{dense}
The matrix $\bmA$ is stored as a compact 
dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
Component $n \ast (i-1) + j$ of the storage array {\tt A\%val} will hold the 
value $a_{ij}$ for $i = 1, \ldots , m$, $j = 1, \ldots , n$.
Since $\bmH$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part 
$h_{ij}$ for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$) need be held. In this case
the lower triangle will be stored by rows, that is 
component $i \ast (i-1)/2 + j$ of the storage array {\tt H\%val}  
will hold the value $h_{ij}$ (and, by symmetry, $h_{ji}$)
for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$.

\subsubsection{Sparse co-ordinate storage format}\label{coordinate}
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored. For the 
$l$-th entry of $\bmA$, its row index $i$, column index $j$ 
and value $a_{ij}$
are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer arrays {\tt A\%row}, 
{\tt A\%col} and real array {\tt A\%val}, respectively.
The order is unimportant, but the total
number of entries {\tt A\%ne} is also required. 
The same scheme is applicable to
$\bmH$ (thus requiring integer arrays {\tt H\%row}, {\tt H\%col}, a real array 
{\tt H\%val} and an integer value {\tt H\%ne}),
except that only the entries in the lower triangle need be stored.

\subsubsection{Sparse row-wise storage format}\label{rowwise}
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in row $i$ appear directly before those
in row $i+1$. For the $i$-th row of $\bmA$, the $i$-th component of a 
integer array {\tt A\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while {\tt A\%ptr} $(m+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices $j$ and values $a_{ij}$ of the entries in the $i$-th row 
are stored in components 
$l =$ {\tt A\%ptr}$(i)$, \ldots ,{\tt A\%ptr} $(i+1)-1$ of the 
integer array {\tt A\%col}, and real array {\tt A\%val}, respectively. 
The same scheme is applicable to
$\bmH$ (thus requiring integer arrays {\tt H\%ptr}, {\tt H\%col}, and 
a real array {\tt H\%val}),
except that only the entries in the lower triangle need be stored.

For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than 
its predecessor.

\subsubsection{Diagonal storage format}\label{diagonal}
If $\bmH$ is diagonal (i.e., $h_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \neq j \leq n$)
only the diagonals entries $h_{ii}$, $1 \leq i \leq n$,  need be stored,
and the first $n$ components of the array {\tt H\%val} may be used for 
the purpose. There is no sensible equivalent for the non-square $\bmA$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% long integers %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Integer kinds}\label{Integer kinds}
We use the term
long \integer\ to denote {\tt INTEGER\-(kind=long)}, where 
{\tt long = selected\_int\_kind(18))}.

%%%%%%%%%%% matrix data type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding matrices}\label{typesmt}
The derived data type {\tt SMT\_TYPE} is used to hold the matrices $\bmA$
and $\bmH$. The components of {\tt SMT\_TYPE} used here are:

\begin{description}

\ittf{m} is a scalar component of type default \integer, 
that holds the number of rows in the matrix. 
 
\ittf{n} is a scalar component of type default \integer, 
that holds the number of columns in the matrix. 
 
\ittf{ne} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that
holds the number of matrix entries.

\ittf{type} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \character, that
is used to indicate the matrix storage scheme used. Its precise length and
content depends on the type of matrix to be stored (see \S\ref{typeprob}).

\ittf{val} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \realdp\, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that holds the values of the entries. 
Each pair of off-diagonal entries $h_{ij} = h_{ji}$ of a {\em symmetric}
matrix $\bmH$ is represented as a single entry 
(see \S\ref{dense}--\ref{rowwise}).
Any duplicated entries that appear in the sparse 
co-ordinate or row-wise schemes will be summed. 

\ittf{row} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the row indices of the entries. 
(see \S\ref{coordinate}).

\ittf{col} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the column indices of the entries
(see \S\ref{coordinate}--\ref{rowwise}).

\ittf{ptr} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt m + 1}, that may hold the pointers to
the first entry in each row (see \S\ref{rowwise}).

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%% problem type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding the problem}\label{typeprob}
The derived data type {\tt QPT\_problem\_type} is used to hold 
the problem. The components of 
{\tt QPT\_problem\_type} 
are:

\begin{description}

\itt{new\_problem\_structure} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, 
 that is \true\ if this is the first (or only) problem in a sequence of 
 problems with identical "structure" to be attempted, and \false\ if 
 a previous problem with the same "structure" (but different
 numerical data) has been solved. Here, the term "structure" refers both to 
 the sparsity patterns of the Jacobian matrices $\bmA$ involved 
 (but not their numerical values), to the zero/nonzero/infinity patterns 
 (a bound is either zero, $\pm$ infinity, or a finite but arbitrary 
 nonzero) of each of the constraint bounds, and to the variables and constraints
 that are fixed (both bounds are the same) or free (the lower and upper
 bounds are $\pm$ infinity, respectively).

\ittf{n} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, 
 that holds the number of optimization variables, $n$.  
              
\ittf{m} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, 
 that holds the number of general linear constraints, $m$.
              
\ittf{H} is scalar variable of type {\tt SMT\_TYPE} 
that holds the Hessian matrix $\bmH$. The following components
are used:

\begin{description}

\itt{H\%type} is an allocatable array of rank one and type default \character, that
is used to indicate the storage scheme used. If the dense storage scheme 
(see Section~\ref{dense}) is used, 
the first five components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt DENSE}.
For the sparse co-ordinate scheme (see Section~\ref{coordinate}), 
the first ten components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt COORDINATE},  
for the sparse row-wise storage scheme (see Section~\ref{rowwise}),
the first fourteen components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS},
and for the diagonal storage scheme (see Section~\ref{diagonal}),
the first eight components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt DIAGONAL}.

For convenience, the procedure {\tt SMT\_put} 
may be used to allocate sufficient space and insert the required keyword
into {\tt H\%type}.
For example, if {\tt prob} is of derived type {\tt \packagename\_problem\_type}
and involves a Hessian we wish to store using the co-ordinate scheme,
we may simply
%\vspace*{-2mm}
{\tt 
\begin{verbatim}
        CALL SMT_put( prob%H%type, 'COORDINATE', istat )
\end{verbatim}
}
%\vspace*{-4mm}
\noindent
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SMT} 
for further details on the use of {\tt SMT\_put}.

\itt{H\%ne} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that 
holds the number of entries in the {\bf lower triangular} part of $\bmH$
in the sparse co-ordinate storage scheme (see Section~\ref{coordinate}). 
It need not be set for any of the other three schemes.

\itt{H\%val} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \realdp, that holds
the values of the entries of the {\bf lower triangular} part
of the Hessian matrix $\bmH$ in any of the 
storage schemes discussed in Section~\ref{galmatrix}.

that holds the row indices of the {\bf lower triangular} part of $\bmH$ 
in the sparse co-ordinate storage
scheme (see Section~\ref{coordinate}). 
It need not be allocated for any of the other three schemes.

\itt{H\%col} is a rank-one allocatable array variable of type default \integer,
that holds the column indices of the {\bf lower triangular} part of 
$\bmH$ in either the sparse co-ordinate 
(see Section~\ref{coordinate}), or the sparse row-wise 
(see Section~\ref{rowwise}) storage scheme.
It need not be allocated when the dense or diagonal storage schemes are used.

\itt{H\%ptr} is a rank-one allocatable array of dimension {\tt n+1} and type 
default \integer, that holds the starting position of 
each row of the {\bf lower triangular} part of $\bmH$, as well
as the total number of entries plus one, in the sparse row-wise storage
scheme (see Section~\ref{rowwise}). It need not be allocated when the
other schemes are used.

\end{description}

\ittf{G} is a rank-one allocatable array of dimension {\tt n} and type 
default \realdp, that holds the gradient $\bmg$ 
of the linear term of the quadratic objective function.
The $j$-th component of 
{\tt G}, $j = 1,  \ldots ,  n$, contains $\bmg_{j}$.

\ittf{f} is a scalar variable of type 
default \realdp, that holds 
the constant term, $f$, in the objective function.

\ittf{A} is scalar variable of type {\tt SMT\_TYPE} 
that holds the Jacobian matrix $\bmA$. The following components are used:

\begin{description}

\itt{A\%type} is an allocatable array of rank one and type default \character, that
is used to indicate the storage scheme used. If the dense storage scheme 
(see Section~\ref{dense}) is used, 
the first five components of {\tt A\%type} must contain the
string {\tt DENSE}.
For the sparse co-ordinate scheme (see Section~\ref{coordinate}), 
the first ten components of {\tt A\%type} must contain the
string {\tt COORDINATE}, while 
for the sparse row-wise storage scheme (see Section~\ref{rowwise}),
the first fourteen components of {\tt A\%type} must contain the
string {\tt SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS}.

Just as for {\tt H\%type} above, the procedure {\tt SMT\_put} 
may be used to allocate sufficient space and insert the required keyword
into {\tt A\%type}.
Once again, if {\tt prob} is of derived type {\tt \packagename\_problem\_type}
and involves a Jacobian we wish to store using the sparse row-wise 
storage scheme, we may simply
%\vspace*{-2mm}
{\tt 
\begin{verbatim}
        CALL SMT_put( prob%A%type, 'SPARSE_BY_ROWS', istat )
\end{verbatim}
}
%\vspace*{-4mm}
\noindent

\itt{A\%ne} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that 
holds the number of entries in $\bmA$
in the sparse co-ordinate storage scheme (see Section~\ref{coordinate}). 
It need not be set for either of the other two schemes.

default \integer, that holds the 
starting position of each row of $\bmA$, as well
as the total number of entries plus one, in the sparse row-wise storage
scheme (see Section~\ref{rowwise}). It need not be allocated when the
other schemes are used.

\end{description}

\ittf{C\_l} is a rank-one allocatable array of dimension {\tt m} and type 
default \realdp, that holds the vector of lower bounds $\bmc^{l}$ 
on the general constraints. The $i$-th component of 
{\tt C\_l}, $i = 1, \ldots , m$, contains $\bmc_{i}^{l}$.

(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}).

\ittf{C\_u} is a rank-one allocatable array of dimension {\tt m} and type

where {\tt infinity} is a component of the control array {\tt control} 
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}).

\ittf{X\_u} is a rank-one allocatable array of dimension {\tt n} and type 
default \realdp, that holds
the vector of upper bounds $\bmx^{u}$ on the variables.
The $j$-th component of {\tt X\_u}, $j = 1, \ldots , n$, 
contains $\bmx_{j}^{u}$.

%%%%%%%%%%% data type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding problem data}\label{typedata}
The derived data type 
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type} 
is used to hold all the data for a particular problem,
or sequences of problems with the same structure, between calls of 
{\tt \packagename} procedures. 
This data should be preserved, untouched, from the initial call to 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
to the final call to
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% argument lists %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galarguments
There are three procedures for user calls
(see Section~\ref{galfeatures} for further features): 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The subroutine 
      {\tt \packagename\_initialize} 
      is used to set default values, and initialize private data, 
      before solving one or more problems with the
      same sparsity and bound structure.
\item The subroutine 
      {\tt \packagename\_solve} 
      is called to solve the problem.
\item The subroutine 
      {\tt \packagename\_terminate} 
      is provided to allow the user to automatically deallocate array 
       components of the private data, allocated by 
       {\tt \packagename\_solve}, 
       at the end of the solution process. 
       It is important to do this if the data object is re-used for another 
       problem {\bf with a different structure}
       since {\tt \packagename\_initialize} cannot test for this situation, 
       and any existing associated targets will subsequently become unreachable.
\end{enumerate}
We use square brackets {\tt [ ]} to indicate \optional\ arguments.

%%%%%% initialization subroutine %%%%%%

\subsubsection{The initialization subroutine}\label{subinit}
 Default values are provided as follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_initialize( data, control, inform )}

\vspace*{-3mm}
\begin{description}

\itt{data} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typedata}). 
It is used to hold data about the problem being solved. 

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}). 
On exit, {\tt control} contains default values for the components as
described in Section~\ref{typecontrol}.
These values should only be changed after calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.

\itt{inform} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typeinform}). A successful call to
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
is indicated when the  component {\tt status} has the value 0. 
For other return values of {\tt status}, see Section~\ref{galerrors}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%% main solution subroutine %%%%%%

\subsubsection{The quadratic programming subroutine}
The quadratic programming solution algorithm is called as follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_solve( p, data, control, inform[, C\_stat, B\_stat] )}

\vspace*{-3mm}
\begin{description}
\ittf{p} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type 
{\tt QPT\_problem\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typeprob}). 
It is used to hold data about the problem being solved.
For a new problem, the user must allocate all the array components,
and set values for all components except {\tt p\%C}.
{\tt p\%new\_problem\_structure} must be set \true, but will have been reset
to \false\ on exit from {\tt \packagename\_solve}.
Users are free to choose whichever
of the matrix formats described in Section~\ref{galmatrix} 
is appropriate for $\bmA$ and $\bmH$ for their application---different 
formats may be used for the two matrices.

For a problem with the same structure as one that has just been 
solved, the user may set {\tt p\%new\_problem\_str\-u\-cture} to \false,
so long as {\tt \packagename\_terminate} has not been called in the interim.
The \integer\ components must be unaltered since the
previous call to {\tt \packagename\_solve}, but the \realdp\ 
may be altered to reflect the new problem.

The components {\tt p\%X}, {\tt p\%Y} and {\tt p\%Z}
must be set to initial estimates, $\bmx^{0}$, of the primal variables, 
$\bmx$, Lagrange multipliers for the general constraints, $\bmy$, 
and dual variables for the bound constraints, $\bmz$, respectively.
Inappropriate initial values will be altered, so the user should
not be overly concerned if suitable values are not apparent, and may be
content with merely setting {\tt p\%X=0.0},
{\tt p\%Y=0.0} and {\tt p\%Z=0.0}.
The component {\tt p\%C} need not be set on entry.

On exit, the components {\tt p\%X}, {\tt p\%Y}, {\tt p\%Z} and {\tt p\%C}
will contain the best estimates of the primal variables $\bmx$, 
Lagrange multipliers for the general
constraints $\bmy$, dual variables for the bound constraints $\bmz$, 
and values of the constraints $\bmA \bmx$ respectively.
What of the remaining problem data has been restored depends upon
the input value of the control parameter {\tt control\%restore\_problem}.
The return format for a restored array component will be the same as its
input format.
\restrictions {\tt p\%n} $> 0$, {\tt p\%m} $\geq 0$,
              {\tt p\%A\%ne} $\geq -2$ and {\tt p\%H\%ne} $\geq -2$.

\itt{data} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typedata}). It is used to hold data about the problem being 
solved. It must not have been altered {\bf by the user} since the last call to 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}). Default values may be assigned by calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize} prior to the first call to 
{\tt \packagename\_solve}.

\itt{inform} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typeinform}). A successful call to
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
is indicated when the  component {\tt status} has the value 0. 
For other return values of {\tt status}, see Section~\ref{galerrors}.

{\tt C\_stat(i)}, {\tt i}$=1, \ldots ,$ {\tt p\%m}, and their meanings are

A negative value of {\tt inform\%status} on exit from 
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
or 
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}
indicates that an error has occurred. No further calls should be made
until the error has been corrected. Possible values are:

\begin{description}

\itt{\galerrallocate.} An allocation error occurred. 
A message indicating the offending

status and a string containing the name of the offending array
are held in {\tt inform\%alloc\_\-status}
and {\tt inform\%bad\_alloc} respectively.

\itt{\galerrdeallocate.} A deallocation error occurred. 
A message indicating the offending

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Further features %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galfeatures
\noindent In this section, we describe an alternative means of setting 
control parameters, that is components of the variable {\tt control} of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}), 
by reading an appropriate data specification file using the
subroutine {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}. This facility
is useful as it allows a user to change  {\tt \packagename} control parameters 
without editing and recompiling programs that call {\tt \packagename}.

A specification file, or specfile, is a data file containing a number of 
"specification commands". Each command occurs on a separate line, 
and comprises a "keyword", 
which is a string (in a close-to-natural language) used to identify a 
control parameter, and 
an (optional) "value", which defines the value to be assigned to the given
control parameter. All keywords and values are case insensitive, 
keywords may be preceded by one or more blanks but
values must not contain blanks, and
each value must be separated from its keyword by at least one blank.
Values must not contain more than 30 characters, and 
each line of the specfile is limited to 80 characters,
including the blanks separating keyword and value.

The portion of the specification file used by 
{\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
must start
with a "{\tt BEGIN \packagename}" command and end with an 
"{\tt END}" command.  The syntax of the specfile is thus defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  ( .. lines ignored by QPB_read_specfile .. )
    BEGIN QPB
       keyword    value
       .......    .....
       keyword    value
    END 
  ( .. lines ignored by QPB_read_specfile .. )
\end{verbatim}
where keyword and value are two strings separated by (at least) one blank.
The ``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiter command lines 
may contain additional (trailing) strings so long as such strings are 
separated by one or more blanks, so that lines such as
\begin{verbatim}
    BEGIN QPB SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
    END QPB SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
are acceptable. Furthermore, 
between the
``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiters,
specification commands may occur in any order.  Blank lines and
lines whose first non-blank character is {\tt !} or {\tt *} are ignored. 
The content 
of a line after a {\tt !} or {\tt *} character is also 
ignored (as is the {\tt !} or {\tt *}
character itself). This provides an easy manner to "comment out" some 
specification commands, or to comment specific values 
of certain control parameters.  

The value of a control parameters may be of three different types, namely
integer, logical or real.
Integer and real values may be expressed in any relevant Fortran integer and
floating-point formats (respectively). Permitted values for logical
parameters are "{\tt ON}", "{\tt TRUE}", "{\tt .TRUE.}", "{\tt T}", 
"{\tt YES}", "{\tt Y}", or "{\tt OFF}", "{\tt NO}",
"{\tt N}", "{\tt FALSE}", "{\tt .FALSE.}" and "{\tt F}". 
Empty values are also allowed for 
logical control parameters, and are interpreted as "{\tt TRUE}".  

The specification file must be open for 
input when {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
is called, and the associated device number 
passed to the routine in device (see below). 
Note that the corresponding 
file is {\tt REWIND}ed, which makes it possible to combine the specifications 
for more than one program/routine.  For the same reason, the file is not
closed by {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}.

Control parameters corresponding to the components 
{\tt LSQP\_control}, 
{\tt SBLS\_control}
and
{\tt GLTR\_control} may be changed by including additional sections enclosed by
``{\tt BEGIN LSQP}'' and 
``{\tt END LSQP}'', 
``{\tt BEGIN SBLS}'' and 
``{\tt END SBLS}'', and
``{\tt BEGIN GLTR}'' and 
``{\tt END GLTR}'', respectively. 
See the specification sheets for the packages 
{\tt \libraryname\_LSQP},
{\tt \libraryname\_SBLS} 
and
{\tt \libraryname\_GLTR}
for further details.

Control parameters may be read from a file as follows:

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentinout argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}). 
Default values should have already been set, perhaps by calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, individual components of {\tt control} may have been changed
according to the commands found in the specfile. Specfile commands and 
the component (see Section~\ref{typecontrol}) of {\tt control} 
that each affects are given in Table~\ref{specfile}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Information printed %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galinfo
If {\tt control\%print\_level} is positive, information about the progress 
of the algorithm will be printed on unit {\tt control\-\%out}.
If {\tt control\%print\_level} $= 1$, a single line of output will be produced 
for each iteration of the process. 
For the initial-feasible-point phase,
this will include values of the current primal and dual infeasibility, and
violation of complementary slackness, the feasibility-phase objective value,
the current steplength, the value of the barrier parameter, the
number of backtracks in the linesearch and the elapsed CPU time in seconds.
Once a suitable feasible point has been found, the iteration is divided
into major iterations, at which the barrier parameter is reduced, and
minor iterations, and which the barrier function is approximately minimized
for the current value of the barrier parameter. For the major iterations,
the value of the barrier parameter, the required values of 
dual feasibility and violation of complementary slackness, and the current
constraint infeasibility are reported. Each minor iteration of the
optimality phase results in a line giving 
the current dual feasibility and violation of complementary slackness, the
objective function value, the ratio of predicted to achieved reduction 
of the objective function, the trust-region radius, the 
number of backtracks in the linesearch, the number of conjugate-gradient 
iterations taken, and the elapsed CPU time in seconds. 

If {\tt control\%print\_level} $\geq 2$ this 
output will be increased to provide significant detail of each iteration. 
This extra output includes residuals of the linear systems solved, and,
for larger values of {\tt control\%print\_level}, values of the primal and dual
variables and Lagrange multipliers.

\galmethod
The required solution $\bmx$ necessarily satisfies 
the primal optimality conditions
\eqn{4.1a}{\bmA \bmx = \bmc}
and 
\eqn{4.1b}{
 \bmc^{l} \leq \bmc \leq \bmc^{u}, \;\;
\bmx^{l} \leq\bmx \leq\bmx^{u},}
the dual optimality conditions
\eqn{4.2a}{
 \bmH \bmx + \bmg =
 \bmA^{T} \bmy + \bmz,\;\;
 \bmy = \bmy^{l} + \bmy^{u} \tim{and}
 \bmz = \bmz^{l} + \bmz^{u} ,}
and 
\eqn{4.2b}{
 \bmy^{l} \geq 0 , \;\;
 \bmy^{u} \leq 0 , \;\;
 \bmz^{l} \geq 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\;
 \bmz^{u} \leq 0 ,}
and the complementary slackness conditions 
\eqn{4.3}{
( \bmA \bmx - \bmc^{l} )^{T} \bmy^{l} = 0  ,\;\;
( \bmA \bmx - \bmc^{u} )^{T} \bmy^{u} = 0  ,\;\;
(\bmx -\bmx^{l} )^{T} \bmz^{l} = 0   \tim{and}
(\bmx -\bmx^{u} )^{T} \bmz^{u} = 0 ,}
where the vectors $\bmy$ and $\bmz$ are 
known as the Lagrange multipliers for
the general linear constraints, and the dual variables for the bounds,
respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold componentwise.

Primal-dual interior point methods iterate towards a point
that satisfies these conditions by ultimately aiming to satisfy
\req{4.1a}, \req{4.2a} and \req{4.3}, while ensuring that 
\req{4.1b} and \req{4.2b} are 
satisfied as strict inequalities at each stage. 
Appropriate norms of the amounts by 
which \req{4.1a}, \req{4.2a} and \req{4.3} fail to be satisfied are known as the
primal and dual infeasibility, and the violation of complementary slackness,
respectively. The fact that \req{4.1b} and \req{4.2b} are satisfied as strict 
inequalities gives such methods their other title, namely 
interior-point methods.

The problem is solved in two phases. The goal of the first 
"initial feasible point" phase is
to find a strictly interior point which is primal feasible, that is that
\req{4.1a} is satisfied. The \galahad\ package {\tt GALAHAD\_LSQP} 
is used for this 
purpose, and offers the options of either accepting the first 
strictly feasible point found, or preferably of aiming for the
so-called "analytic center" of the feasible region.
Having found such a suitable initial feasible point, the second "optimality"
phase ensures that \req{4.1a} remains satisfied while iterating to
satisfy dual feasibility \req{4.2a} and complementary slackness \req{4.3}.
The optimality phase proceeds by approximately minimizing a 
sequence of barrier functions
\disp{\half \bmx^T \bmH \bmx + \bmg^T \bmx + f -
 \mu \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log ( c_{i}  -  c_{i}^{l} )
 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log ( c_{i}^{u}  -  c_{i} )
 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \log ( x_{j}  -  x_{j}^{l} ) 
 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \log ( x_{j}^{u}  -  x_{j} ) \right] ,}
for an approriate sequence of positive barrier parameters $\mu$ 
converging to zero
while ensuring that \req{4.1a} remain satisfied and that 
$\bmx$ and $\bmc$ are strictly interior points for \req{4.1b}. 
Note that terms in the above sumations corresponding to infinite bounds are
ignored, and that equality constraints are treated specially.

Each of the barrier subproblems is solved using a trust-region method.
Such a method generates a trial correction step $\Delta (\bmx, \bmc)$
to the current iterate $(\bmx, \bmc)$
by replacing the nonlinear barrier function locally by a suitable 
quadratic model, and approximately minimizing this model in the 
intersection of \req{4.1a}
and a trust region $\|\Delta (\bmx, \bmc)\| \leq \Delta$
for some appropriate
strictly positive trust-region radius $\Delta$ and norm $\| \cdot \|$.
The step is accepted/rejected
and the radius adjusted on the basis of how accurately the model reproduces the
value of barrier function at the trial step. If the step proves to be 
unacceptable, a linesearch is performed along the step to obtain an acceptable 
new iterate. In practice, the natural primal "Newton" model of the barrier 
function is frequently less successful than an alternative primal-dual model, 
and consequently the primal-dual model is usually to be preferred.

Once a barrier subproblem has been solved, extrapolation 
based on values and derivatives encountered on the central path 
is optionally used to determine a good starting point for the next subproblem.
Traditional Taylor-series extrapolation has been superceded by more accurate
Puiseux-series methods as these are particularly suited to deal with 
degeneracy.

The trust-region subproblem is approximately solved using the 
combined conjugate-gradient/Lanczos method implemented in the 
\galahad\ package {\tt GALAHAD\_GLTR}. 
Such a method requires a suitable preconditioner,
and in our case, the only flexibility we have is in approximating the
model of the Hessian. Although using a fixed form of preconditioning is
sometimes effective, we have provided the option of an automatic choice,
that aims to balance the cost of applying the preconditioner against
the needs for an accurate solution of the trust-region subproblem. 
The preconditioner is applied using the \galahad\ matrix factorization package 
{\tt GALAHAD\_SBLS}, but options at this stage are
to factorize the preconditioner as a whole (the so-called "augmented system"
approach), or to perform a block elimination first (the "Schur-complement"
approach). The latter is usually to be prefered when a (non-singular) diagonal 
preconditioner is used, but may be inefficient if any of the columns
of $\bmA$ is too dense.

In order to make the solution as efficient as possible, the 
variables and constraints are reordered internally
by the \galahad\ package {\tt GALAHAD\_QPP} prior to solution. 
In particular, fixed variables, and 
free (unbounded on both sides) constraints are temporarily removed.

\disp{\bmH = \mat{ccc}{1 & & 4 \\ & 2 & \\ 4 &  & 3}, \;\;
 \bmg = \vect{ 0 \\ 2 \\ 0 }, \;\;
\bmx^{l} = \vect{ -1 \\ - \infty \\ - \infty } \tim{and}
\bmx^{u} = \vect{ 1 \\ \infty \\ 2 },}
and
\disp{
 \bmA = \mat{ccc}{ 2 & 1 & \\ & 1 & 1},\;\;
 \bmc^{l} = \vect{ 1 \\ 2 }, \tim{and}
 \bmc^{u} = \vect{ 2 \\ 2 }}
in sparse co-ordinate format,
we may use the following code:

{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageexample}
}
\noindent
This produces the following output:
{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageresults}
}
\noindent
The same problem may be solved holding the data in 
a sparse row-wise storage format by replacing the lines
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
!  sparse co-ordinate storage format
...
! problem data complete   
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
by
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
! sparse row-wise storage format
   CALL SMT_put( p%H%type, 'SPARSE_BY_ROWS', s )  ! Specify sparse-by-row
   CALL SMT_put( p%A%type, 'SPARSE_BY_ROWS', s )  ! storage for H and A
   ALLOCATE( p%H%val( h_ne ), p%H%col( h_ne ), p%H%ptr( n + 1 ) )
   ALLOCATE( p%A%val( a_ne ), p%A%col( a_ne ), p%A%ptr( m + 1 ) )
   p%H%val = (/ 1.0_wp, 2.0_wp, 3.0_wp, 4.0_wp /) ! Hessian H
   p%H%col = (/ 1, 2, 3, 1 /)                     ! NB lower triangular
   p%H%ptr = (/ 1, 2, 3, 5 /)                     ! Set row pointers
   p%A%val = (/ 2.0_wp, 1.0_wp, 1.0_wp, 1.0_wp /) ! Jacobian A
   p%A%col = (/ 1, 2, 2, 3 /)
   p%A%ptr = (/ 1, 3, 5 /)                        ! Set row pointers  
! problem data complete   
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
or using a dense storage format with the replacement lines
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
! dense storage format
   CALL SMT_put( p%H%type, 'DENSE', s )  ! Specify dense
   CALL SMT_put( p%A%type, 'DENSE', s )  ! storage for H and A
   ALLOCATE( p%H%val( n * ( n + 1 ) / 2 ) )
   ALLOCATE( p%A%val( n * m ) )
   p%H%val = (/ 1.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 2.0_wp, 4.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 3.0_wp /) ! Hessian
   p%A%val = (/ 2.0_wp, 1.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 1.0_wp, 1.0_wp /) ! Jacobian
! problem data complete   
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
respectively.

If instead $\bmH$ had been the diagonal matrix
\disp{\bmH = \mat{ccc}{1 & &   \\ & 0 & \\  &  & 3}}
but the other data is as before, the diagonal storage scheme 
might be used for $\bmH$, and in this case we would instead 
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
   CALL SMT_put( prob%H%type, 'DIAGONAL', s )  ! Specify dense storage for H
   ALLOCATE( p%H%val( n ) )
   p%H%val = (/ 1.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 3.0_wp /) ! Hessian values
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
Notice here that zero diagonal entries are stored.
