%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary
Given real $n$ by $n$ symmetric matrices $\bmH$ and $\bmM$
(with $\bmM$ positive definite), real
$n$ vectors $\bmc$ and $\bmo$, and scalars $\sigma\geq 0$, $\epsilon\geq 0$
and $f_0$, this package finds an
{\bf approximate minimizer of the regularised objective function}
\disp{\half \bmx^T \bmH \bmx + \bmc^T \bmx + f_0 +
\sfrac{1}{p} \sigma [ \| \bmx + \bmo \|_{\bmM}^2 + \epsilon ]^{p/2},}
where $\|  \bmv \|_{\bmM} = \sqrt{\bmv^T \bmM \bmv}$ is
the $\bmM$-norm of $\bmv$.
This problem commonly occurs as a subproblem in nonlinear
optimization calculations involving cubic regularisation.
The method may be suitable for large $n$ as no factorization of $\bmH$ is
required. Reverse communication is used to obtain
matrix-vector products of the form $\bmH \bmz$, $\bmM^{-1} \bmz$
and, perhaps, $\bmM \bmz$.

\input{kinds}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% derived types %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galtypes
Three derived data types are accessible from the package.

%%%%%%%%%%% control type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding control
 parameters}\label{typecontrol}
The derived data type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
is used to hold controlling data. Default values may be obtained by calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
(see Section~\ref{subinit}). The components of
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
are:

\begin{description}
\itt{error} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that holds the
stream number for error messages.
Printing of error messages in
{\tt \packagename\_solve} and {\tt \packagename\_terminate}
is suppressed if ${\tt error} \leq {\tt 0}$.
The default is {\tt error = 6}.

\ittf{out} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that holds the
stream number for informational messages.
Printing of informational messages in
{\tt \packagename\_solve} is suppressed if ${\tt out} < {\tt 0}$.
The default is {\tt out = 6}.

\itt{print\_level} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that is used
to control the amount of informational output which is required. No
informational output will occur if ${\tt print\_level} \leq {\tt 0}$. If
{\tt print\_level = 1} a single line of output will be produced for each
iteration of the process. If {\tt print\_level} $\geq$ {\tt 2} this output
will be increased to provide significant detail of each iteration.
The default is {\tt print\_level = 0}.

\itt{itmax} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that holds the
maximum number of iterations which will be allowed in
{\tt \packagename\_solve}.
If {\tt itmax} is set to a negative number, it will be reset by
{\tt \packagename\_solve} to $n$.
The default is {\tt itmax = -1}.

\itt{extra\_vectors} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that specifies the number of additional vectors of length $n$
that will be allocated to try to speed up the computation during the
second pass.
The default is {\tt extra\_vectors = 0}.

\itt{stopping\_rule} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that
flags the stopping rule to be used (see {\tt stop\_relative} and
{\tt stop\_absolute} below).
Appropriate values are in the range $[0,2]$, and any value outside this range
will be interpreted as 0.
The default is {\tt stopping\_rule = 0}.

\itt{freq} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that
defines the frequency at which the tridiagonal subproblem will
be solved. Specifically, the subproblem will be solved on iterations
$k=1+$ {\tt freq} $\ast i$, for $i = 1, 2, \ldots.$.
If {\tt itmax} is $\leq 1$, it will be reset by
{\tt \packagename\_solve} to 1.
The default is {\tt freq = 1}.

\itt{unitm} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
must be set \true\ if the matrix $\bmM$ is the identity matrix, and
\false\ otherwise.
The default is {\tt unitm = \true}.

\itt{space\_critical} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
may be set \true\ if the user wishes the package to allocate as little
internal storage as possible, and \false\ otherwise. The package may
be more efficient if {\tt space\_critical} is set \false.
The default is {\tt space\_critical = \false}.

\itt{deallocate\_error\_fatal} is a scalar variable of type default \logical,
that may be set \true\ if the user wishes the package to return to the user
in the unlikely event that an internal array deallocation fails,
and \false\ if the package should be allowed to try to continue.
The default is {\tt deallocate\_error\_fatal = \false}.

\itt{stop\_relative} and {\tt stop\_absolute} are scalar variables of type
\realdp, that holds the
relative and absolute convergence tolerances (see Section~\ref{galmethod}).
The computed solution $\bmx$ is accepted by {\tt \packagename\_solve}
if the computed value of
$\|\bmH \bmx + \lambda \bmM \bmx + \bmc\|_{{\bmM^{-1}}} $ is less than or equal
to $\max (\nu \| \bmc\|_{\bmM^{-1}} \ast$ {\tt stop\_relative},
{\tt stop\_absolute}$)$, where $\lambda =
\sigma [ \|\bmx+\bmo\|_{\bmM}^2 + \epsilon]^{p/2-1}$ and $\nu$
depends on the stopping rule selected by %\linebreak
{\tt stopping\_\_rule}:
for  {\tt stopping\_rule} = 0, $\nu = 1$,
for  {\tt stopping\_rule} = 1, $\nu = \min( 1, \|\bmx\|)$, and
for  \linebreak {\tt stopping\_rule} = 2,
$\nu = \min( 1, \|\bmx\|/ \max(1,\sigma))$.
The defaults are {\tt stop\_relative = $\sqrt{u}$} and
{\tt stop\_absolute = 0.0},
where $u$ is {\tt EPSILON(1.0)} ({\tt EPSILON(1.0D0)} in
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double}).

\itt{fraction\_opt} is a scalar variable of type default
\realdp, that specifies the fraction
of the optimal value which is to be considered acceptable by the algorithm.
A negative value is considered to be zero, and a value of larger than one
is considered to be one. Reducing {\tt fraction\_opt} below one will result
in a reduction of the computation performed at the expense of an inferior
optimal value.
The default is {\tt fraction\_opt = 1.0}.

\itt{f\_0} is a scalar variable of type default
\realdp, that gives the value of the constant term $f_0$ in the
objective function. This value has no effect on the
computed minimizer $\bmx$. The default is {\tt f\_0 = 0.0}.

\itt{rminvr\_zero} is a scalar variable of type default
\realdp, that gives the smallest value that the square of the $\bmM$-norm of
the gradient of the objective function may be before it is considered to be
zero.
The default is {\tt rminvr\_zero = 10 $u$},
where $u$ is {\tt EPSILON(1.0)} ({\tt EPSILON(1.0D0)} in
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double}).

\itt{prefix} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 30, that may be used to provide a user-selected
character string to preface every line of printed output.
Specifically, each line of output will be prefaced by the string
{\tt prefix(2:LEN(TRIM(prefix))-1)},
thus ignoring the first and last non-null components of the
supplied string. If the user does not want to preface lines by such
a string, they may use the default {\tt prefix = ""}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%% inform type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding informational
 parameters}\label{typeinfo}
The derived data type
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
is used to hold parameters that give information about the progress and needs
of the algorithm. The components of
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
are:

\begin{description}
\itt{status} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that gives the
current status of the algorithm. See Sections~\ref{galreverse} and
\ref{galerrors} for details.

\itt{alloc\_status} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that gives the status of the last internal array allocation
or deallocation. This will be 0 if {\tt status = 0}.

\itt{bad\_alloc} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 80, that  gives the name of the last internal array
for which there were allocation or deallocation errors.
This will be the null string if {\tt status = 0}.

\itt{obj} is a scalar variable of type \realdp, that holds the
value of the quadratic function $\half \bmx^T \bmH \bmx + \bmc^T \bmx + f_0$.

\itt{obj\_regularized} is a scalar variable of type \realdp, that
holds the value of the regularized objective function $\half \bmx^T \bmH \bmx
 + \bmc^T \bmx + f_0 +
  \sfrac{1}{p} \sigma [ \| \bmx + \bmo \|_{\bmM}^2 + \epsilon ]^{p/2}$.

\itt{multiplier} is a scalar variable of type default
\realdp, that holds the value of the multiplier $\lambda =
\sigma [ \|\bmx+\bmo\|_{\bmM}^2 + \epsilon]^{p/2-1}$.

\itt{leftmost} is a scalar variable of type default
\realdp, that holds an estimate of the leftmost eigenvalue of the
matrix pencil $(\bmH,\bmM)$.

\ittf{iter} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that holds the
current number of Lanczos vectors used.

\itt{iter\_pass2} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that holds the
current number of Lanczos vectors used in the second pass.

\itt{negative\_curvature} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
is set \true\ if $\bmH$ has been found to be indefinite during the calculation
and \false\ otherwise.
\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%% data type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding problem data}\label{typedata}
The derived data type
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
is used to hold all the data for a particular problem between calls of
{\tt \packagename} procedures.
This data should be preserved, untouched, from the initial call to
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
to the final call to
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% argument lists %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galarguments
There are three procedures for user calls
(see Section~\ref{galfeatures} for further features):

\begin{enumerate}
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_initialize}
      is used to set default values, and initialize private data.
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_solve}
      is called repeatedly to solve the problem.
      On each exit, the user may be expected to provide additional
      information and, if necessary, re-enter the subroutine.
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_terminate}
      is provided to allow the user to automatically deallocate array
       components of the private data, allocated by
       {\tt \packagename\_solve},
       at the end of the solution process.
       It is important to do this if the data object is re-used for another
       problem since {\tt \packagename\_initialize} cannot test for this
       situation,
       and any existing associated targets will subsequently become
       unreachable.
\end{enumerate}
We use square brackets {\tt [ ]} to indicate \optional\ arguments.

%%%%%% initialization subroutine %%%%%%

\subsubsection{The initialization subroutine}\label{subinit}
 Default values are provided as follows:

\hskip0.5in
{\tt CALL \packagename\_initialize( data, control, inform )}

\begin{description}

\itt{data} is a scalar \intentinout argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typedata}). It is used to hold data about the problem being
solved.

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentout argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}).
On exit, {\tt control} contains default values for the components as
described in Section~\ref{typecontrol}.
These values should only be changed after calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.

\itt{inform} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typeinfo}). A successful call to
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
is indicated when the  component {\tt status} has the value 0.
For other return values of {\tt status}, see Section~\ref{galerrors}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%% problem solution subroutine %%%%%%

\subsubsection{The optimization problem solution subroutine}
The optimization problem solution algorithm is called as follows:

\hskip0.5in
{\tt CALL \packagename\_solve( n, p, sigma, X, R, VECTOR, data, control, inform[, eps, O] )}

\begin{description}

\ittf{n} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type \integer, that must be
set to the number of unknowns, $n$. {\bf Restriction: } $n  >  0$.

\ittf{p} is a scalar \intentin\ variable of type default
\realdp,
that must be set on initial entry to the desired order $p$ of regularisation.
{\bf Restriction: } $p \geq 2$.

\itt{sigma} is a scalar \intentin\ variable of type default
\realdp,
that must be set on initial entry
to the value of the weight $\sigma$ associated with the regularisation term.
{\bf Restriction: } $\sigma \geq 0$.

\ittf{X} is an array \intentinout\ argument of dimension {\tt n} and
type \realdp,
that holds an estimate of the solution $\bmx$ of the linear system.
On initial entry, {\tt X} need not be set.
It must not be changed between entries.
On exit, {\tt X} contains the current best estimate of the solution.

\ittf{R} is an array \intentinout\ argument of dimension {\tt n} and
type \realdp,
that is used to hold the gradient $\bmH \bmx  +  \bmc$ of the objective
function at the current estimate of the solution.
On initial entry, {\tt R} must contain the vector $\bmc$.
If {\tt inform\%status} = 5 on exit, it must be reset to  $\bmc$; otherwise
it must be left unchanged. On exit, {\tt R} contains the gradient of the
objective   function at the current best estimate of the solution.

\itt{VECTOR} is an array \intentinout\ argument of dimension {\tt n}
and type \realdp,
that is used to pass information from and to {\tt \packagename\_solve},
as explained in Section~\ref{galreverse}.
On initial entry, {\tt VECTOR} need not be set. On exit, the actual content of
the array depends on the value of the parameter {\tt inform\%status}
(see Section~\ref{galreverse}).

\itt{data} is a scalar \intentinout argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typedata}). It is used to hold data about the problem being
solved. It must not have been altered {\bf by the user} since the last call to
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}.
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}).
Default values may be assigned by calling {\tt \packagename\_initialize}
prior to the first call to {\tt \packagename\_solve}.

\itt{inform} is a scalar \intentinout argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typeinfo}).
On initial entry, the component {\tt status} must be set to {\tt 1.}
The remaining components need not be set.
A successful call to
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
is indicated when the  component {\tt status} has the value 0.
For other return values of {\tt status}, see Sections~\ref{galreverse}
and \ref{galerrors}.

\ittf{eps} is an optional scalar \intentin\ variable of type default
\realdp. If {\tt eps} is \present, it must be set on initial entry
to the value of the shift $\epsilon$ associated with the regularisation term.
{\bf Restriction: } $\epsilon \geq 0$.

\ittf{O} is an optional array \intentin\ variable of type default
\realdp. If {\tt O} is \present, it must be set on initial entry
to the value of the offset $o$ associated with the regularisation term.

\end{description}

%%%%%%% termination subroutine %%%%%%

\subsubsection{The  termination subroutine}
All previously allocated arrays are deallocated as follows:

\hskip0.5in
{\tt CALL \packagename\_terminate( data, control, inform )}

\begin{description}

\itt{data} is a scalar \intentinout argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
exactly as for
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
that must not have been altered {\bf by the user} since the last call to
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, array components will have been deallocated.

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentin argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
exactly as for
{\tt \packagename\_solve}.

\itt{inform} is a scalar \intentout argument of type {\tt \packagename\_type}
exactly as for
{\tt \packagename\_solve}.
Only the component {\tt status} will be set on exit, and a
successful call to
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}
is indicated when this  component {\tt status} has the value 0.
For other return values of {\tt status}, see Section~\ref{galerrors}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Reverse communications %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galreverse
A positive value of {\tt inform\%status} on exit from
{\tt \packagename\_solve} indicates that the user needs to take appropriate
action before re-entering the subroutine. Possible values are:

\begin{description}

\itt{2.} The user must perform the preconditioning operation
\disp{\bmy := \bmM^{-1} \bmz,}
and recall {\tt \packagename\_solve}.
The vector $\bmz$ is available in the array {\tt VECTOR}, and the result
$\bmy$ must be placed in {\tt VECTOR}.
No argument except {\tt VECTOR} should be altered before recalling
{\tt \packagename\_solve}. This return can only occur when
{\tt control\%unitm} is \false.

\itt{3.} The user must perform the matrix-vector product
\disp{\bmy := \bmH \bmz}
and recall {\tt \packagename\_solve}.
The vector $\bmz$ is available in the array {\tt VECTOR}, and the result
$\bmy$ must be placed in {\tt VECTOR}.
No argument except {\tt VECTOR} should be altered before recalling
{\tt \packagename\_solve}.

\itt{4.}  The user should reset {\tt R} to $\bmc$ and recall
{\tt \packagename\_solve}.
No argument except {\tt R} should be altered before recalling
{\tt \packagename\_solve}.

\itt{5.} The user must perform the operation
\disp{\bmy := \bmM \bmz,}
and recall {\tt \packagename\_solve}.
The vector $\bmz$ is available in the array {\tt VECTOR}, and the result
$\bmy$ must be placed in {\tt VECTOR}.
No argument except {\tt VECTOR} should be altered before recalling
{\tt \packagename\_solve}. This return can only occur when
both {\tt control\%unitm} is \false\ and {\tt O} is \present.
\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Warning and error messages %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galerrors
A negative value of  {\tt inform\%status} on exit from
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
or
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}
indicates that an error has occurred. No further calls should be made
until the error has been corrected. Possible values are:

\begin{description}
 \itt{\galerrallocate.} An allocation error occurred. A message indicating
the offending
array is written on unit {\tt control\%error}, and the returned allocation
status and a string containing the name of the offending array
are held in {\tt inform\%alloc\_\-status}
and {\tt inform\%bad\_alloc} respectively.

\itt{\galerrdeallocate.} A deallocation error occurred.
A message indicating the offending
array is written on unit {\tt control\%error} and the returned allocation
status and a string containing the name of the offending array
are held in {\tt inform\%alloc\_\-status}
and {\tt inform\%bad\_alloc} respectively.

\itt{\galerrrestrictions.} ({\tt \packagename\_solve} only)
One or more of the restrictions
{\tt n > 0}, {\tt sigma} $\geq 0$, {\tt eps} $\geq 0$ or {\tt p} $\geq 2$
has been violated.

\itt{\galerrunbounded.} ({\tt \packagename\_solve} only) The problem is unbounded
from below. This can only happen if $p \leq 2$. In this case, the
problem is unbounded along the arc {\tt X} $+\alpha$ {\tt VECTOR} as
$\alpha$ increases.

\itt{\galerrpreconditioner.} ({\tt \packagename\_solve} only)
The matrix $\bmM$ appears not to be positive definite.

\itt{\galerrmaxiterations.} ({\tt \packagename\_solve} only) More than
{\tt control\%itmax} iterations have been performed without obtaining
convergence.

\itt{\galerrinput.} ({\tt \packagename\_solve} only)  {\tt inform\%status} is
not $>$ 0 on entry.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Re-entry %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Re-entry with a new value of $\sigma$}
It commonly happens that, having solved the problem for a particular value
of the weight $\sigma$, a user now wishes to solve the problem for a different
value of $\sigma$. Rather than restarting the calculation with
{\tt inform\%status = 1,} a useful approximation may be found
resetting {\tt sigma} to the new required value and {\tt R} to $\bmc$,
and recalling {\tt \packagename\_solve}
with {\tt inform\%status = 6} and the remaining arguments unchanged.
This will determine the best solution within the Krylov space investigated
in the previous minimization (see Section~\ref{galmethod}).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Further features %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galfeatures
\noindent In this section, we describe an alternative means of setting
control parameters, that is components of the variable {\tt control} of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}),
by reading an appropriate data specification file using the
subroutine {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}. This facility
is useful as it allows a user to change  {\tt \packagename} control parameters
without editing and recompiling programs that call {\tt \packagename}.

A specification file, or specfile, is a data file containing a number of
"specification commands". Each command occurs on a separate line,
and comprises a "keyword",
which is a string (in a close-to-natural language) used to identify a
control parameter, and
an (optional) "value", which defines the value to be assigned to the given
control parameter. All keywords and values are case insensitive,
keywords may be preceded by one or more blanks but
values must not contain blanks, and
each value must be separated from its keyword by at least one blank.
Values must not contain more than 30 characters, and
each line of the specfile is limited to 80 characters,
including the blanks separating keyword and value.

The portion of the specification file used by
{\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
must start
with a "{\tt BEGIN \packagename}" command and end with an
"{\tt END}" command.  The syntax of the specfile is thus defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  ( .. lines ignored by GLRT_read_specfile .. )
    BEGIN GLRT
       keyword    value
       .......    .....
       keyword    value
    END
  ( .. lines ignored by GLRT_read_specfile .. )
\end{verbatim}
where keyword and value are two strings separated by (at least) one blank.
The ``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiter command lines
may contain additional (trailing) strings so long as such strings are
separated by one or more blanks, so that lines such as
\begin{verbatim}
    BEGIN GLRT SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
    END GLRT SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
are acceptable. Furthermore,
between the
``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiters,
specification commands may occur in any order.  Blank lines and
lines whose first non-blank character is {\tt !} or {\tt *} are ignored.
The content
of a line after a {\tt !} or {\tt *} character is also
ignored (as is the {\tt !} or {\tt *}
character itself). This provides an easy manner to "comment out" some
specification commands, or to comment specific values
of certain control parameters.

The value of a control parameters may be of three different types, namely
integer, logical or real.
Integer and real values may be expressed in any relevant Fortran integer and
floating-point formats (respectively). Permitted values for logical
parameters are "{\tt ON}", "{\tt TRUE}", "{\tt .TRUE.}", "{\tt T}",
"{\tt YES}", "{\tt Y}", or "{\tt OFF}", "{\tt NO}",
"{\tt N}", "{\tt FALSE}", "{\tt .FALSE.}" and "{\tt F}".
Empty values are also allowed for
logical control parameters, and are interpreted as "{\tt TRUE}".

The specification file must be open for
input when {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
is called, and the associated device number
passed to the routine in device (see below).
Note that the corresponding
file is {\tt REWIND}ed, which makes it possible to combine the specifications
for more than one program/routine.  For the same reason, the file is not
closed by {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}.

\subsubsection{To read control parameters from a specification file}
\label{readspec}

Control parameters may be read from a file as follows:
\hskip0.5in
\def\baselinestretch{0.8} {\tt \begin{verbatim}
     CALL GLRT_read_specfile( control, device )
\end{verbatim}}
\def\baselinestretch{1.0}

\begin{description}
\itt{control} is a scalar \intentinout argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}).
Default values should have already been set, perhaps by calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, individual components of {\tt control} may have been changed
according to the commands found in the specfile. Specfile commands and
the component (see Section~\ref{typecontrol}) of {\tt control}
that each affects are given in Table~\ref{specfile}.

\itt{device} is a scalar \intentin argument of type \integer,
that must be set to the unit number on which the specfile
has been opened. If {\tt device} is not open, {\tt control} will
not be altered and execution will continue, but an error message

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Information printed %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galinfo
If {\tt control\%print\_level} is positive, information about the progress
of the algorithm will be printed on unit {\tt control\-\%\-out}.
If {\tt control\%print\_level = 1}, a single line of output will be produced
for each iteration of the process. This will include
the iteration number, the value of the objective function, the
$\bmM^{-1}$-norm of its gradient
$\| ( \bmH + \lambda \bmM ) \bmx + \bmc \|_{\bmM^{-1}}$,
the value of the multiplier $\lambda =
\sigma [ \|\bmx+\bmo\|_{\bmM}^2 + \epsilon ]^{p/2-1}$,
the number of Newton steps required to find $\lambda$, and the exit
code from this calculation (0 = successful, 1 = 1, stalled, 2 = more than
100 steps).
If {\tt control\%print\_level} $\geq$ {\tt 2}, this
output will be increased to provide significant detail of each iteration.
This extra output includes a complete history of the inner iteration required
to solve the ``tridiagonal'' subproblem, and for each Newton iteration records
the estimate of $\lambda$, the error
$\theta(\lambda) = [ \|\bmx+\bmo\|_{\bmM}^2 + \epsilon ]^{p/2-1}
- \lambda / \sigma$ and the $\bmM$-norm of $\bmx$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% METHOD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmethod
The required solution $\bmx$ necessarily satisfies the optimality condition
$\bmH \bmx + \lambda \bmM \bmx + \bmc + \lambda \bmo = 0$, where
$\lambda = \sigma [ \|\bmx+\bmo\|_{\bmM}^2 + \epsilon ]^{p/2-1}$.
In addition, the matrix $\bmH + \lambda \bmM$ will be positive semi-definite.

\noindent
The method is iterative. Starting  with the vector $\bmM^{-1} \bmc$,
a matrix of Lanczos vectors is built one column at a time
so that the $k$-th column is generated during
iteration $k$. These columns span a so-called Krylov space.
The resulting $n$ by $k$ matrix $\bmQ_k $ has the
property that $\bmQ_{k}^T \bmH \bmQ_k^{}  =  \bmT_{k}^{}$,
where $\bmT_k$ is tridiagonal. An approximation to the
required solution may then be expressed formally as
\disp{\bmx_{k+1}  =  \bmQ_k \bmy_k}
where $\bmy_k $ solves the ``tridiagonal'' subproblem of minimizing
\eqn{4.1}{\half  \bmy^T \bmT_k \bmy  + \| \bmc\|_{\bmM^{-1} } \bme_{1}^T \bmy +
\sfrac{1}{p} \sigma [ \| \bmy + \bmd \|_2^2 + \epsilon ]^{p/2},}
where $\bmd = \bmQ_k^T \bmM \bmo$ and $\bme_1$ is the first unit vector.

To minimize \req{4.1}, the optimality conditions
\eqn{4.2}{ ( \bmT_k + \lambda \bmI ) \bmy(\lambda) = - \bmc - \lambda \bmd,}
where $\lambda = \sigma [ \|\bmy(\lambda)+\bmd\|_{\bmM}^2 + \epsilon]^{p/2-1}$
are used as the basis of an iteration. Specifically, given an estimate
$\lambda$ for which $ \bmT_k + \lambda \bmI$ is positive definite,
the tridiagonal system \req{4.2} may be efficiently solved to give
$\bmy(\lambda)$. It is then simply a matter of adjusting $\lambda$
(for example by a Newton-like process) to solve the scalar nonlinear equation
\eqn{4.3}{\theta(\lambda) \equiv
[ \|\bmy(\lambda)+\bmd\|_{\bmM}^2 + \epsilon]^{p/2-1}
 - \frac{\lambda}{\sigma} = 0.}
In practice \req{4.3} is reformulated, and a more rapidly converging iteration is
used.

It is possible to measure the optimality measure
$\|\bmH \bmx  +  \lambda \bmM \bmx  +  \bmc + \lambda \bmo\|_{\bmM^{-1}}$
without computing $\bmx_{k+1}$, and thus without
needing $\bmQ_k $. Once this measure is sufficiently small, a second pass
is required to obtain the estimate $\bmx_{k+1} $ from $\bmy_k $.
As this second pass is an additional expense, a record is kept of the
optimal objective function values for each value of $k$, and the second
pass is only performed so far as to ensure a given fraction of the
final optimal objective value. Large savings may be made in the second
pass by choosing the required fraction to be significantly smaller than one.

Special code is used in the special case $p=2$, as in this case a single
pass suffices.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galexample
Suppose we wish to solve a problem in 10,000 unknowns, whose data is
\disp{\bmH  = \mat{ccccc}{ -2 & 1 \\ 1 & -2 & . \\ & . & . & . \\ & & . & -2 & 1
                           \\ & & & 1 & -2 }, \;\;
\bmM  = \mat{ccccc}{ 2 &   \\   & 2  &   \\ & & . \\ & & & 2 & \\ & & & & 2 }, \;\;
\bmc  =  \vect{ 1 \\ 1 \\ . \\ 1 \\ 1 }
\tim{and}
\bmo  =  - \vect{ 1 \\ 1 \\ . \\ 1 \\ 1 },}
with a weight $\sigma = 10$ and shift $\epsilon = 1$.
Suppose further that we are content with an approximation which is within 99\%
of the best. Then we may use the following code
