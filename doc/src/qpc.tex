%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary
This package uses a crossover method, switching
between interior-point and working-set approaches,
to solve the {\bf quadratic programming problem}
\disp{\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(\bmx) = \half \bmx^T \bmH \bmx + \bmg^T \bmx + f}
subject to the general linear constraints
\disp{c_{i}^{l}  \leq  \bma_{i}^{T}\bmx  \leq  c_{i}^{u}, \;\;\;
 i = 1, \ldots , m,}
and the simple bound constraints
\disp{x_{j}^{l}  \leq  x_{j}^{ } \leq  x_{j}^{u} , \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,}
where the $n$ by $n$ symmetric matrix $\bmH$, the 
vectors $\bmg$, $\bma_{i}$, $\bmc^{l}$, $\bmc^{u}$, $\bmx^{l}$, 
$\bmx^{u}$ and the scalar $f$ are given.
Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix $\bmH$ or the
vectors $\bma_{i}$. 
Any of the constraint bounds $c_{i}^{l}$, $c_{i}^{u}$, 
$x_{j}^{l}$ and $x_{j}^{u}$ may be infinite.

If the matrix $\bmH$ is positive semi-definite, a global
solution is found. However, if $\bmH$ is indefinite,
the procedure may find  a (weak second-order) critical point 
that is not the global solution to the given problem.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO USE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galhowto

The package is available using both single and double precision reals, 
and either 32-bit or 64-bit integers. Access to the 32-bit integer,
single precision version requires the {\tt USE} statement

\medskip
\noindent
with the obvious substitution {\tt \fullpackagename\_double},
{\tt \fullpackagename\_single\_64} and 
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double\_64} for the other variants.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% matrix formats %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmatrix
Both the Hessian matrix $\bmH$ and
the constraint Jacobian $\bmA$, the matrix 
whose rows are the vectors $\bma_{i}^{T}$, $i = 1, \ldots , m$, 
may be stored in a variety of input formats.

\subsubsection{Dense storage format}\label{dense}
The matrix $\bmA$ is stored as a compact 
dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
Component $n \ast (i-1) + j$ of the storage array {\tt A\%val} will hold the 
value $a_{ij}$ for $i = 1, \ldots , m$, $j = 1, \ldots , n$.
Since $\bmH$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part 
$h_{ij}$ for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$) need be held. In this case
the lower triangle will be stored by rows, that is 
component $i \ast (i-1)/2 + j$ of the storage array {\tt H\%val}  
will hold the value $h_{ij}$ (and, by symmetry, $h_{ji}$)
for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$.

\subsubsection{Sparse co-ordinate storage format}\label{coordinate}
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored. For the 
$l$-th entry of $\bmA$, its row index $i$, column index $j$ 
and value $a_{ij}$
are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer arrays {\tt A\%row}, 
{\tt A\%col} and real array {\tt A\%val}, respectively.
The order is unimportant, but the total
number of entries {\tt A\%ne} is also required. 
The same scheme is applicable to
$\bmH$ (thus requiring integer arrays {\tt H\%row}, {\tt H\%col}, a real array 
{\tt H\%val} and an integer value {\tt H\%ne}),
except that only the entries in the lower triangle need be stored.

\subsubsection{Sparse row-wise storage format}\label{rowwise}
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in row $i$ appear directly before those
in row $i+1$. For the $i$-th row of $\bmA$, the $i$-th component of a 
integer array {\tt A\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while {\tt A\%ptr} $(m+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices $j$ and values $a_{ij}$ of the entries in the $i$-th row 
are stored in components 
$l =$ {\tt A\%ptr}$(i)$, \ldots ,{\tt A\%ptr} $(i+1)-1$ of the 
integer array {\tt A\%col}, and real array {\tt A\%val}, respectively. 
The same scheme is applicable to
$\bmH$ (thus requiring integer arrays {\tt H\%ptr}, {\tt H\%col}, and 
a real array {\tt H\%val}),
except that only the entries in the lower triangle need be stored.

For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than 
its predecessor.

\subsubsection{Diagonal storage format}\label{diagonal}
If $\bmH$ is diagonal (i.e., $h_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \neq j \leq n$)
only the diagonals entries $h_{ii}$, $1 \leq i \leq n$,  need be stored,
and the first $n$ components of the array {\tt H\%val} may be used for 
the purpose. There is no sensible equivalent for the non-square $\bmA$.

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding matrices}\label{typesmt}
The derived data type {\tt SMT\_TYPE} is used to hold the matrices $\bmA$
and $\bmH$. The components of {\tt SMT\_TYPE} used here are:

\begin{description}

\ittf{m} is a scalar component of type \integer, 
that holds the number of rows in the matrix. 
 
\ittf{n} is a scalar component of type \integer, 
that holds the number of columns in the matrix. 
 
\ittf{ne} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that
holds the number of matrix entries.

\ittf{type} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \character, that
is used to indicate the matrix storage scheme used. Its precise length and
content depends on the type of matrix to be stored (see \S\ref{typeprob}).

\ittf{val} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \realdp\, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that holds the values of the entries. 
Each pair of off-diagonal entries $h_{ij} = h_{ji}$ of a {\em symmetric}
matrix $\bmH$ is represented as a single entry 
(see \S\ref{dense}--\ref{rowwise}).
Any duplicated entries that appear in the sparse 
co-ordinate or row-wise schemes will be summed. 

\ittf{row} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the row indices of the entries. 
(see \S\ref{coordinate}).

\ittf{col} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may the column indices of the entries
(see \S\ref{coordinate}--\ref{rowwise}).

\ittf{ptr} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt m + 1}, that may hold the pointers to
the first entry in each row (see \S\ref{rowwise}).

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%% problem type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding the problem}\label{typeprob}
The derived data type {\tt QPT\_problem\_type} is used to hold 
the problem. The components of 
{\tt QPT\_problem\_type} 
are:

\begin{description}

\itt{new\_problem\_structure} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, 
 that is \true\ if this is the first (or only) problem in a sequence of 
 problems with identical "structure" to be attempted, and \false\ if 
 a previous problem with the same "structure" (but different
 numerical data) has been solved. Here, the term "structure" refers both to 
 the sparsity patterns of the Jacobian matrices $\bmA$ involved 
 (but not their numerical values), to the zero/nonzero/infinity patterns 
 (a bound is either zero, $\pm$ infinity, or a finite but arbitrary 
 nonzero) of each of the constraint bounds, and to the variables and constraints
 that are fixed (both bounds are the same) or free (the lower and upper
 bounds are $\pm$ infinity, respectively).

\ittf{n} is a scalar variable of type \integer, 
 that holds the number of optimization variables, $n$.  
              
\ittf{m} is a scalar variable of type \integer, 
 that holds the number of general linear constraints, $m$.
              
\ittf{H} is scalar variable of type {\tt SMT\_TYPE} 
that holds the Hessian matrix $\bmH$. The following components
are used:

\begin{description}

\itt{H\%type} is an allocatable array of rank one and type default \character, that
is used to indicate the storage scheme used. If the dense storage scheme 
(see Section~\ref{dense}) is used, 
the first five components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt DENSE}.
For the sparse co-ordinate scheme (see Section~\ref{coordinate}), 
the first ten components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt COORDINATE},  
for the sparse row-wise storage scheme (see Section~\ref{rowwise}),
the first fourteen components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS},
and for the diagonal storage scheme (see Section~\ref{diagonal}),
the first eight components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt DIAGONAL}.

For convenience, the procedure {\tt SMT\_put} 
may be used to allocate sufficient space and insert the required keyword
into {\tt H\%type}.
For example, if {\tt prob} is of derived type {\tt \packagename\_problem\_type}
and involves a Hessian we wish to store using the co-ordinate scheme,
we may simply
%\vspace*{-2mm}
{\tt 
\begin{verbatim}
        CALL SMT_put( prob%H%type, 'COORDINATE' )
\end{verbatim}
}
%\vspace*{-4mm}
\noindent
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SMT} 
for further details on the use of {\tt SMT\_put}.

\itt{H\%ne} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that 
holds the number of entries in the {\bf lower triangular} part of $\bmH$

scheme (see Section~\ref{coordinate}). 
It need not be allocated for any of the other three schemes.

\itt{H\%col} is a rank-one allocatable array variable of type \integer,
that holds the column indices of the {\bf lower triangular} part of 
$\bmH$ in either the sparse co-ordinate 
(see Section~\ref{coordinate}), or the sparse row-wise 
(see Section~\ref{rowwise}) storage scheme.
It need not be allocated when the dense or diagonal storage schemes are used.

\itt{H\%ptr} is a rank-one allocatable array of dimension {\tt n+1} and type 
\integer, that holds the starting position of 
each row of the {\bf lower triangular} part of $\bmH$, as well
as the total number of entries plus one, in the sparse row-wise storage
scheme (see Section~\ref{rowwise}). It need not be allocated when the
other schemes are used.

\end{description}

\ittf{G} is a rank-one allocatable array of dimension {\tt n} and type 
\realdp, that holds the gradient $\bmg$ 
of the linear term of the quadratic objective function.
The $j$-th component of 
{\tt G}, $j = 1,  \ldots ,  n$, contains $\bmg_{j}$.

\ittf{f} is a scalar variable of type 
\realdp, that holds 
the constant term, $f$, in the objective function.

\ittf{A} is scalar variable of type {\tt SMT\_TYPE} 
that holds the Jacobian matrix $\bmA$. The following components are used:

\begin{description}

\itt{A\%type} is an allocatable array of rank one and type default \character, that
is used to indicate the storage scheme used. If the dense storage scheme 
(see Section~\ref{dense}) is used, 
the first five components of {\tt A\%type} must contain the
string {\tt DENSE}.
For the sparse co-ordinate scheme (see Section~\ref{coordinate}), 
the first ten components of {\tt A\%type} must contain the
string {\tt COORDINATE}, while 
for the sparse row-wise storage scheme (see Section~\ref{rowwise}),
the first fourteen components of {\tt A\%type} must contain the
string {\tt SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS}.

Just as for {\tt H\%type} above, the procedure {\tt SMT\_put} 
may be used to allocate sufficient space and insert the required keyword
into {\tt A\%type}.
Once again, if {\tt prob} is of derived type {\tt \packagename\_problem\_type}
and involves a Jacobian we wish to store using the sparse row-wise 
storage scheme, we may simply
%\vspace*{-2mm}
{\tt 
\begin{verbatim}
        CALL SMT_put( prob%A%type, 'SPARSE_BY_ROWS' )
\end{verbatim}
}
%\vspace*{-4mm}
\noindent

\itt{A\%ne} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that

other schemes are used.

contains $\bmx_{j}^{u}$.

\itt{convex} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, 
that must be set \true\ if the problem is convex (i.e., if the matrix
$\bmH$ is positive semi-definite) and 
the user wishes to take advantage of the fact,
and  \false\ otherwise. The package will usually run faster for
convex problems if {\tt convex} is \true, but {\tt convex} 
must be set \false\ if the user is uncertain as otherwise the
package may fail. The default is {\tt convex = .FALSE.}.

\itt{treat\_zero\_bounds\_as\_general} is a scalar variable of type 
default \logical.
If it is set to \false, variables which 
are only bounded on one side, and whose bound is zero,
will be recognised as non-negativities/non-positivities rather than simply as
lower- or upper-bounded variables.
If it is set to \true, any variable bound 
$x_{j}^{l}$ or $x_{j}^{u}$ which has the value 0.0 will be
treated as if it had a general value.
Setting {\tt treat\_zero\_bounds\_as\_general} to \true\ has the advantage
that if a sequence of problems are reordered, then bounds which are
``accidentally'' zero will be considered to have the same structure as
those which are nonzero. However, {\tt \fullpackagename} is
able to take special advantage of non-negativities/non-positivities, so
if a single problem, or if a sequence of problems whose 
bound structure is known not to change, is/are to be solved, 
it will pay to set the variable to \false.
The default is {\tt treat\_zero\_bounds\_as\_general = .FALSE.}.

%\itt{array\_syntax\_worse\_than\_do\_loop} is a scalar variable of type 
%default \logical, that should be set \true\ if the compiler is
%better able to optimize Fortran 77-style do-loops than to exploit 
%Fortran 95-style array syntax when performing vector operations,
%and \false\ otherwise. 
%The default is {\tt array\_syntax\_worse\_than\_do\_loop = .FALSE.}.

\itt{space\_critical} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, 
that must be set \true\ if space is critical when allocating arrays
and  \false\ otherwise. The package may run faster if 
{\tt space\_critical} is \false\ but at the possible expense of a larger
storage requirement. The default is {\tt space\_critical = .FALSE.}.

\itt{deallocate\_error\_fatal} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, 
that must be set \true\ if the user wishes to terminate execution if
a deallocation  fails, and \false\ if an attempt to continue
will be made. The default is {\tt deallocate\_error\_fatal = .FALSE.}.

\itt{no\_qpa} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, 
that must be set \true\ if the user wishes to skip the working-set phase
of the computation, and \false\ if this phase is required.
The default is {\tt no\_qpa = .FALSE.}.

\itt{no\_qpb} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, 
that must be set \true\ if the user wishes to skip the interior-point phase
of the computation, and \false\ if this phase is required.
The default is {\tt no\_qpa = .FALSE.}.

\itt{qpb\_or\_qpa} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, 
that must be set \true\ if the user wishes to use the interior-point phase
of the computation, but only to follow this with the working-set phase
if the former is unsuccessful, and to \false\ if both phases are to be used
(subject to the requests made in {\tt no\_qpa} and {\tt no\_qpb}).
The default is {\tt qpb\_or\_qpa = .FALSE.}.

\itt{prefix} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 30, that may be used to provide a user-selected 
character string to preface every line of printed output. 
Specifically, each line of output will be prefaced by the string 
{\tt prefix(2:LEN(TRIM(prefix))-1)},
thus ignoring the first and last non-null components of the
supplied string. If the user does not want to preface lines by such
a string, they may use the default {\tt prefix = ""}.

\itt{QPA\_control} is a scalar variable of type 
{\tt QPA\_control\_type} (see Section~\ref{typeqpacontrol}
whose components are used to control the working-set phase of the calculation,
performed by the package 
{\tt \libraryname\_QPA}. 

\itt{QPB\_control} is a scalar variable of type 
{\tt QPB\_control\_type} (see Section~\ref{typeqpbcontrol}
whose components are used to control the interior-point phase of the 
calculation,
performed by the package 
{\tt \libraryname\_QPB}.

equality-constrained phase of the calculation (if any),
performed by the package 
{\tt \libraryname\_EQP}. 

\itt{FDC\_control} is a scalar variable of type

performed by the package

%%%%%%%%%%% data type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding problem data}\label{typedata}
The derived data type 
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type} 
is used to hold all the data for a particular problem,
or sequences of problems with the same structure, between calls of 
{\tt \packagename} procedures. 
This data should be preserved, untouched, from the initial call to 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
to the final call to
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% argument lists %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galarguments
There are three procedures for user calls
(see Section~\ref{galfeatures} for further features): 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The subroutine 
      {\tt \packagename\_initialize} 
      is used to set default values, and initialize private data, 
      before solving one or more problems with the
      same sparsity and bound structure.
\item The subroutine 
      {\tt \packagename\_solve} 
      is called to solve the problem.
\item The subroutine 
      {\tt \packagename\_terminate} 
      is provided to allow the user to automatically deallocate array 
       components of the private data, allocated by 
       {\tt \packagename\_solve}, 
       at the end of the solution process. 
       It is important to do this if the data object is re-used for another 
       problem {\bf with a different structure}
       since {\tt \packagename\_initialize} cannot test for this situation, 
       and any existing associated targets will subsequently become unreachable.
\end{enumerate}
We use square brackets {\tt [ ]} to indicate \optional\ arguments.

%%%%%% initialization subroutine %%%%%%

\subsubsection{The initialization subroutine}\label{subinit}
 Default values are provided as follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_initialize( data, control, inform )}

\vspace*{-3mm}
\begin{description}

\itt{data} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typedata}). It is used to hold data about the problem being 
solved. 

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}). 
On exit, {\tt control} contains default values for the components as
described in Section~\ref{typecontrol}.
These values should only be changed after calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.

\itt{inform} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typeinform}). A successful call to
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
is indicated when the  component {\tt status} has the value 0. 
For other return values of {\tt status}, see Section~\ref{galerrors}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%% main solution subroutine %%%%%%

\subsubsection{The quadratic programming subroutine}\label{qps}
The quadratic programming solution algorithm is called as follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_solve( p, C\_stat, B\_stat, data, control, inform )}

\vspace*{-3mm}
\begin{description}
\ittf{p} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type 
{\tt QPT\_problem\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typeprob}). 
It is used to hold data about the problem being solved.
For a new problem, the user must allocate all the array components,
and set values for all components except {\tt p\%C}.
{\tt p\%new\_problem\_structure} must be set \true, but will have been reset
to \false\ on exit from {\tt \packagename\_solve}.
Users are free to choose whichever
of the matrix formats described in Section~\ref{galmatrix} 
is appropriate for $\bmA$ and $\bmH$ for their application---different 
formats may be used for the two matrices.

For a problem with the same structure as one that has just been 
solved, the user may set {\tt p\%new\_problem\-\_str\-u\-cture} to \false,
so long as {\tt \packagename\_terminate} has not been called in the interim.
The \integer\ components must be unaltered since the
previous call to {\tt \packagename\_solve}, but the \realdp\ 
may be altered to reflect the new problem.

The components {\tt p\%X}, {\tt p\%Y} and {\tt p\%Z}
must be set to initial estimates, $\bmx^{0}$, of the primal variables, 
$\bmx$, Lagrange multipliers for the general constraints, $\bmy$, 
and dual variables for the bound constraints, $\bmz$, respectively.
Inappropriate initial values will be altered, so the user should
not be overly concerned if suitable values are not apparent, and may be
content with merely setting {\tt p\%X=0.0},
{\tt p\%Y=0.0} and {\tt p\%Z=0.0}.
The component {\tt p\%C} need not be set on entry.

On exit, the components {\tt p\%X}, {\tt p\%Y}, {\tt p\%Z} and {\tt p\%C}
will contain the best estimates of the primal variables $\bmx$, 
Lagrange multipliers for the general
constraints $\bmy$, dual variables for the bound constraints $\bmz$, 
and values of the constraints $\bmA \bmx$ respectively.
What of the remaining problem data has been restored depends upon
the input value of the control parameter {\tt control\%restore\_problem}.
The return format for a restored array component will be the same as its
input format.
\restrictions {\tt p\%n} $> 0$, {\tt p\%m} $\geq 0$,
              {\tt p\%A\%ne} $\geq -2$ and {\tt p\%H\%ne} $\geq -2$.

\itt{C\_stat} is a rank-one \intentinout\ array argument of dimension {\tt p\%m}
and type \integer, that indicates which of the general linear
constraints are in the current working set. Possible values for 
{\tt C\_stat(i)}, {\tt i}$=1, \ldots ,$ {\tt p\%m}, and their meanings are
\begin{description}
\itt{<0} the $i$-th general constraint 
is in the working set, on its lower bound,
\itt{>0} the $i$-th general constraint 
is in the working set, on its upper bound, and
\itt{0}  the $i$-th general constraint is not in the working set.
\end{description}
Suitable values must be supplied if 
{\tt control\%qpa\_control\%cold\_start = 0} on entry,
but need not be provided for other input values of {\tt control\%cold\_start}.
Inappropriate values will be ignored.
On exit, {\tt C\_stat} will contain values appropriate for the ultimate
working set.

\itt{B\_stat} is a rank-one \intentinout\ array argument of dimension {\tt p\%n}
and type \integer, that indicates which of the simple bound 
constraints are in the current working set. Possible values for 
{\tt B\_stat(j)}, {\tt j}$=1, \ldots ,$ {\tt p\%n}, and their meanings are
\begin{description}
\itt{<0} the $j$-th simple bound constraint 
is in the working set, on its lower bound,
\itt{>0} the $j$-th simple bound constraint 
is in the working set, on its upper bound, and
\itt{0}  the $j$-th simple bound constraint is not in the working set.
\end{description}
Suitable values must be supplied if 
{\tt control\%qpa\_control\%cold\_start = 0} on entry,
but need not be provided for other input values of {\tt control\%cold\_start}.
Inappropriate values will be ignored.
On exit, {\tt B\_stat} will contain values appropriate for the ultimate
working set.

\itt{data} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typedata}). It is used to hold data about the problem being 
solved. It must not have been altered {\bf by the user} since the last call to 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}). Default values may be assigned by calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize} prior to the first call to 
{\tt \packagename\_solve}.

\itt{inform} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typeinform}). A successful call to
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
is indicated when the  component {\tt status} has the value 0. 
For other return values of {\tt status}, see Section~\ref{galerrors}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%% termination subroutine %%%%%%

\subsubsection{The  termination subroutine}
All previously allocated arrays are deallocated as follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_terminate( data, control, inform )}

\vspace*{-3mm}
\begin{description}

\itt{data} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type

exactly as for
{\tt \packagename\_solve},
which must not have been altered {\bf by the user} since the last call to 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, array components will have been deallocated.

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type

\itt{inform} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type

{\tt \packagename\_terminate}
is indicated when this  component {\tt status} has the value 0. 
For other return values of {\tt status}, see Section~\ref{galerrors}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Warning and error messages %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galerrors
A negative value of {\tt inform\%status} on exit from 
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
or 
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}
indicates that an error has occurred. No further calls should be made
until the error has been corrected. Possible values are:

\begin{description}

\itt{\galerrallocate.} An allocation error occurred. A message indicating 
the offending 
array is written on unit {\tt control\%error}, and the returned allocation 
status and a string containing the name of the offending array
are held in {\tt inform\%alloc\_\-status}
and {\tt inform\%bad\_alloc} respectively.

\itt{\galerrdeallocate.} A deallocation error occurred. 
A message indicating the offending 
array is written on unit {\tt control\%error} and the returned allocation 
status and a string containing the name of the offending array
are held in {\tt inform\%alloc\_\-status}
and {\tt inform\%bad\_alloc} respectively.

\itt{\galerrrestrictions.} One of the restrictions 
 {\tt prob\%n} $> 0$ or {\tt prob\%m} $\geq  0$
    or requirements that {\tt prob\%A\_type} 
    and {\tt prob\%H\_type} contain its relevant string
    {\tt 'DENSE'}, {\tt 'COORDINATE'}, {\tt 'SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS'}
    or {\tt 'DIAGONAL'}
    has been violated.

%\itt{-3.} At least one of the arrays 
% {\tt p\%A\_val}, {\tt p\%A\_row}, {\tt p\%A\_col},
% {\tt p\%H\_val}, {\tt p\%H\_row} or {\tt p\%H\_col},
% is not large enough to hold the original, or reordered, matrices $\bmA$
% or $\bmH$.

\itt{\galerrbadbounds.} The bound constraints are inconsistent.

\itt{\galerrprimalinfeasible.} The constraints appear to have no feasible point.

\itt{\galerrunbounded.} The objective function appears to be unbounded 
  from below on the feasible set.

\itt{\galerranalysis.} The analysis phase of the factorization failed; 
  the return status from the factorization
    package is given in the component {\tt inform\%fac\-t\-or\_status}.

\itt{\galerrfactorization.} The factorization failed; the return status 
  from the factorization
    package is given in the component {\tt inform\%fac\-t\-or\_status}.

\itt{\galerrillconditioned.} The problem is so ill-conditioned that 
 further progress is impossible.

\itt{\galerrtinystep.} The step is too small to make further impact.

\itt{\galerrmaxiterations.} Too many iterations have been performed. 
   This may happen if
    {\tt control\%maxit} is too small, but may also be symptomatic of 
    a badly scaled problem.

\itt{\galerrcpulimit.} The elapsed CPU or system clock time limit has been 
    reached. This may happen if either {\tt control\%cpu\_time\_limit} or
    {\tt control\%clock\_time\_limit} is too small, but may also be symptomatic 
    of a badly scaled problem.

\itt{\galerrupperentry.} An entry from the strict upper triangle of $\bmH$ 
 has been specified.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Further features %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galfeatures
\noindent In this section, we describe an alternative means of setting 
control parameters, that is components of the variable {\tt control} of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}), 
by reading an appropriate data specification file using the
subroutine {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}. This facility
is useful as it allows a user to change  {\tt \packagename} control parameters 
without editing and recompiling programs that call {\tt \packagename}.

A specification file, or specfile, is a data file containing a number of 
"specification commands". Each command occurs on a separate line, 
and comprises a "keyword", 
which is a string (in a close-to-natural language) used to identify a 
control parameter, and 
an (optional) "value", which defines the value to be assigned to the given
control parameter. All keywords and values are case insensitive, 
keywords may be preceded by one or more blanks but
values must not contain blanks, and
each value must be separated from its keyword by at least one blank.
Values must not contain more than 30 characters, and 
each line of the specfile is limited to 80 characters,
including the blanks separating keyword and value.



The portion of the specification file used by 
{\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
must start
with a "{\tt BEGIN \packagename}" command and end with an 
"{\tt END}" command.  The syntax of the specfile is thus defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  ( .. lines ignored by QPC_read_specfile .. )
    BEGIN QPC
       keyword    value
       .......    .....
       keyword    value
    END 
  ( .. lines ignored by QPC_read_specfile .. )
\end{verbatim}
where keyword and value are two strings separated by (at least) one blank.
The ``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiter command lines 
may contain additional (trailing) strings so long as such strings are 
separated by one or more blanks, so that lines such as
\begin{verbatim}
    BEGIN QPC SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
    END QPC SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
are acceptable. Furthermore, 
between the
``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiters,
specification commands may occur in any order.  Blank lines and
lines whose first non-blank character is {\tt !} or {\tt *} are ignored. 
The content 
of a line after a {\tt !} or {\tt *} character is also 
ignored (as is the {\tt !} or {\tt *}
character itself). This provides an easy manner to "comment out" some 
specification commands, or to comment specific values 
of certain control parameters.  

The value of a control parameters may be of three different types, namely
integer, logical or real.
Integer and real values may be expressed in any relevant Fortran integer and
floating-point formats (respectively). Permitted values for logical
parameters are "{\tt ON}", "{\tt TRUE}", "{\tt .TRUE.}", "{\tt T}", 
"{\tt YES}", "{\tt Y}", or "{\tt OFF}", "{\tt NO}",
"{\tt N}", "{\tt FALSE}", "{\tt .FALSE.}" and "{\tt F}". 
Empty values are also allowed for 
logical control parameters, and are interpreted as "{\tt TRUE}".  

The specification file must be open for 
input when {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
is called, and the associated device number 
passed to the routine in device (see below). 
Note that the corresponding 
file is {\tt REWIND}ed, which makes it possible to combine the specifications 
for more than one program/routine.  For the same reason, the file is not
closed by {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}.

Control parameters corresponding to the components 
{\tt CQP\_control}, {\tt QPA\_control}
and
{\tt QPB\_control} may be changed by including additional sections enclosed by
``{\tt BEGIN CQP}'' and 
``{\tt END CQP}'',
``{\tt BEGIN QPA}'' and 
``{\tt END QPA}'', and
``{\tt BEGIN QPB}'' and 
``{\tt END QPB}'', respectively. 
See the specification sheets for the packages 
{\tt \libraryname\_CQP},
{\tt \libraryname\_QPA} 
and
{\tt \libraryname\_QPB}
for further details.

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentinout argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}). 
Default values should have already been set, perhaps by calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, individual components of {\tt control} may have been changed
according to the commands found in the specfile. Specfile commands and 
the component (see Section~\ref{typecontrol}) of {\tt control} 
that each affects are given in Table~\ref{specfile}.

\itt{device} is a scalar \intentin argument of type \integer,
that must be set to the unit number on which the specfile
has been opened. If {\tt device} is not open, {\tt control} will
not be altered and execution will continue, but an error message
will be printed on unit {\tt control\%error}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Information printed %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galinfo
If {\tt control\%print\_level} is positive, information about the progress 
of the algorithm will be printed on unit {\tt control\-\%out}.
If {\tt control\%print\_level} $= 1$, a single line of output will be produced 
for each iteration of the process. 
For the initial-feasible-point phase,
this will include values of the current primal and dual infeasibility, and
violation of complementary slackness, the feasibility-phase objective value,
the current steplength, the value of the barrier parameter, the
number of backtracks in the linesearch and the elapsed CPU time in seconds.
Once a suitable feasible point has been found, the iteration is divided
into major iterations, at which the barrier parameter is reduced, and
minor iterations, and which the barrier function is approximately minimized
for the current value of the barrier parameter. For the major iterations,
the value of the barrier parameter, the required values of 
dual feasibility and violation of complementary slackness, and the current
constraint infeasibility are reported. Each minor iteration of the
optimality phase results in a line giving 
the current dual feasibility and violation of complementary slackness, the
objective function value, the ratio of predicted to achieved reduction 
of the objective function, the trust-region radius, the 
number of backtracks in the linesearch, the number of conjugate-gradient 
iterations taken, and the elapsed CPU time in seconds. 

If {\tt control\%print\_level} $\geq 2$ this 
output will be increased to provide significant detail of each iteration. 
This extra output includes residuals of the linear systems solved, and,
for larger values of {\tt control\%print\_level}, values of the primal and dual
variables and Lagrange multipliers.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% METHOD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmethod
The required solution $\bmx$ necessarily satisfies 
the primal optimality conditions
\eqn{4.1a}{\bmA \bmx = \bmc}
and 
\eqn{4.1b}{
 \bmc^{l} \leq \bmc \leq \bmc^{u}, \;\;
\bmx^{l} \leq\bmx \leq\bmx^{u},}
the dual optimality conditions
\eqn{4.2a}{
 \bmH \bmx + \bmg =
 \bmA^{T} \bmy + \bmz,\;\;
 \bmy = \bmy^{l} + \bmy^{u} \tim{and}
 \bmz = \bmz^{l} + \bmz^{u} ,}
and 
\eqn{4.2b}{
 \bmy^{l} \geq 0 , \;\;
 \bmy^{u} \leq 0 , \;\;
 \bmz^{l} \geq 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\;
 \bmz^{u} \leq 0 ,}
and the complementary slackness conditions 
\eqn{4.3}{
( \bmA \bmx - \bmc^{l} )^{T} \bmy^{l} = 0  ,\;\;
( \bmA \bmx - \bmc^{u} )^{T} \bmy^{u} = 0  ,\;\;
(\bmx -\bmx^{l} )^{T} \bmz^{l} = 0   \tim{and}
(\bmx -\bmx^{u} )^{T} \bmz^{u} = 0 ,}
where the vectors $\bmy$ and $\bmz$ are 
known as the Lagrange multipliers for
the general linear constraints, and the dual variables for the bounds,
respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold component-wise.
Primal-dual interior point methods iterate towards a point
that satisfies these conditions by ultimately aiming to satisfy
\req{4.1a}, \req{4.2a} and \req{4.3}, while ensuring that 
\req{4.1b} and \req{4.2b} are 
satisfied as strict inequalities at each stage. 
Appropriate norms of the amounts by 
which \req{4.1a}, \req{4.2a} and \req{4.3} fail to be satisfied are known as the
primal and dual infeasibility, and the violation of complementary slackness,
respectively. The fact that \req{4.1b} and \req{4.2b} are satisfied as strict 
inequalities gives such methods their other title, namely 
interior-point methods.

The problem is solved in three phases. The goal of the first 
"initial feasible point" phase is
to find a strictly interior point which is primal feasible, that is that
\req{4.1a} is satisfied. The \galahad\ package {\tt GALAHAD\_LSQP} 
is used for this 
purpose, and offers the options of either accepting the first 
strictly feasible point found, or preferably of aiming for the
so-called "analytic center" of the feasible region.
Having found such a suitable initial feasible point, the second "optimality"
phase ensures that \req{4.1a} remains satisfied while iterating to satisfy 
accurately (but not exactly) the dual feasibility \req{4.2a} 
and complementary slackness \req{4.3}
using the \galahad\ package {\tt GALAHAD\_QPB}.
This optimality phase proceeds by approximately minimizing a 
sequence of barrier functions
\disp{q(\bmx) -
 \mu \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log ( c_{i}  -  c_{i}^{l} )
 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log ( c_{i}^{u}  -  c_{i} )
 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \log ( x_{j}  -  x_{j}^{l} ) 
 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \log ( x_{j}^{u}  -  x_{j} ) \right] ,}
for an approriate sequence of positive barrier parameters $\mu$ 
converging to zero
while ensuring that \req{4.1a} remain satisfied and that 
$\bmx$ and $\bmc$ are strictly interior points for \req{4.1b}. 
Note that terms in the above sumations corresponding to infinite bounds are
ignored, and that equality constraints are treated specially.
See the documentation of {\tt GALAHAD\_QPB}.for more details.

Since {\tt GALAHAD\_QPB} may not give a fully accurate solution, the
last phase uses the \galahad\ package {\tt GALAHAD\_QPA}
to refine this solution. This package uses a active/working-set method
to solve the related $\mathbf{\ell_1}$ quadratic programming problem
\disp{\minin{\bmx \in \smallRe^n} q(\bmx) + \rho_g v_g(\bmx) +
\rho_b v_b(\bmx),}
where the he infeasibilities
\disp{v_g(\bmx) = 
   \sum_{i=1}^{m} \max ( c_{i}^{l} - \bma_i^T \bmx, 0 )
 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \max ( \bma_i^T \bmx - c_{i}^{u}, 0 )}
and
\disp{v_b(\bmx) = 
   \sum_{j=1}^{n} \max ( x_{j}^{l} - x_{j}  , 0 )
 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \max ( x_{j}  - x_{j}^{u} , 0 ) ,}
and $\rho_g$ and $\rho_b$ are appropriately chosen positive weights.
See the documentation of {\tt GALAHAD\_QPA}.for more details.

In order to make the solution as efficient as possible, the 
variables and constraints are reordered internally
by the \galahad\ package {\tt GALAHAD\_QPP} prior to solution. 
In particular, fixed variables, and 
free (unbounded on both sides) constraints are temporarily removed.

If at any stage only equality constraints remain, a much simpler
equality-constrained phase is performed, by
\galahad\ package {\tt GALAHAD\_EQP}, in place of the 
three inequality-based phases described above.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galexample
Suppose we wish to minimize
$\half x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \threehalves x_3^2 + 4 x_1 x_3 + 2 x_2 + 1$
subject to the the general linear constraints
$1 \leq  2 x_{1}  +  x_{2}  \leq  2$ and
$x_{2}  +  x_{3}  =  2$, and simple bounds
$-1  \leq  x_{1}  \leq  1$ and $x_{3}  \leq  2$.
Then, on writing the data for this problem as
\disp{\bmH = \mat{ccc}{1 & & 4 \\ & 2 & \\ 4 &  & 3}, \;\;
 \bmg = \vect{ 0 \\ 2 \\ 0 }, \;\;
\bmx^{l} = \vect{ -1 \\ - \infty \\ - \infty } \tim{and}
\bmx^{u} = \vect{ 1 \\ \infty \\ 2 },}
and
\disp{
 \bmA = \mat{ccc}{ 2 & 1 & \\ & 1 & 1},\;\;
 \bmc^{l} = \vect{ 1 \\ 2 }, \tim{and}
 \bmc^{u} = \vect{ 2 \\ 2 }}
in sparse co-ordinate format,
we may use the following code:

{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageexample}

\noindent
This produces the following output:
{\tt \small

The same problem may be solved holding the data in 
a sparse row-wise storage format by replacing the lines
{\tt \small

by
{\tt \small

or using a dense storage format with the replacement lines

respectively.

If instead $\bmH$ had been the diagonal matrix
\disp{\bmH = \mat{ccc}{1 & &   \\ & 0 & \\  &  & 3}}
but the other data is as before, the diagonal storage scheme 
might be used for $\bmH$, and in this case we would instead 
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
   CALL SMT_put( prob%H%type, 'DIAGONAL', s )  ! Specify dense storage for H
   ALLOCATE( p%H%val( n ) )
   p%H%val = (/ 1.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 3.0_wp /) ! Hessian values
\end{verbatim}
}
