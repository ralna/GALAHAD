%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary
This package uses an iterative method
to solve the {\bf equality-constrained quadratic programming problem}
\eqn{qp}{\mbox{minimize}\;\; \half \bmx^T \bmH \bmx + \bmg^T \bmx + f}
subject to the linear constraints
\eqn{lc}{\bmA \bmx  + \bmc = \bmzero,}
where the $n$ by $n$ symmetric matrix $\bmH$, the $m$ by $n$ matrix $\bmA$, 
the  vectors $\bmg$ and $\bmc$, and the scalar $f$ are given.
Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrices $\bmH$ 
and $\bmA$.

The package may alternatively be used to minimize the (shifted) 
squared-least-distance objective
\eqn{lsqp}{\half \sum_{j=1}^n w_j^2 ( x_j^{ } - x_j^0 )^2 + \bmg^T \bmx + f,}
subject to the linear constraints \req{lc}, 
for given vectors $\bmw$ and $\bmx^{0}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO USE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galhowto

The package is available using both single and double precision reals, 
and either 32-bit or 64-bit integers. Access to the 32-bit integer,
single precision version requires the {\tt USE} statement
\medskip

\hspace{8mm} {\tt USE \fullpackagename\_single}

\medskip
\noindent
with the obvious substitution {\tt \fullpackagename\_double},
{\tt \fullpackagename\_single\_64} and 
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double\_64} for the other variants.

\noindent

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% matrix formats %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmatrix
Both the Hessian matrix $\bmH$ and the constraint Jacobian $\bmA$
may be stored in a variety of input formats.

\subsubsection{Dense storage format}\label{dense}
The matrix $\bmA$ is stored as a compact 
dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
Component $n \ast (i-1) + j$ of the storage array {\tt A\%val} will hold the 
value $a_{ij}$ for $i = 1, \ldots , m$, $j = 1, \ldots , n$.
Since $\bmH$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part 
$h_{ij}$ for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$) need be held. In this case
the lower triangle will be stored by rows, that is 
component $i \ast (i-1)/2 + j$ of the storage array {\tt H\%val}  
will hold the value $h_{ij}$ (and, by symmetry, $h_{ji}$)
for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$.

\subsubsection{Sparse co-ordinate storage format}\label{coordinate}
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored. For the 
$l$-th entry of $\bmA$, its row index $i$, column index $j$ 
and value $a_{ij}$
are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer arrays {\tt A\%row}, 
{\tt A\%col} and real array {\tt A\%val}, respectively.
The order is unimportant, but the total
number of entries {\tt A\%ne} is also required. 
The same scheme is applicable to
$\bmH$ (thus requiring integer arrays {\tt H\%row}, {\tt H\%col}, a real array 
{\tt H\%val} and an integer value {\tt H\%ne}),
except that only the entries in the lower triangle need be stored.

\subsubsection{Sparse row-wise storage format}\label{rowwise}
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in row $i$ appear directly before those
in row $i+1$. For the $i$-th row of $\bmA$, the $i$-th component of a 
integer array {\tt A\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while {\tt A\%ptr} $(m+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices $j$ and values $a_{ij}$ of the entries in the $i$-th row 
are stored in components 
$l =$ {\tt A\%ptr}$(i)$, \ldots ,{\tt A\%ptr} $(i+1)-1$ of the 
integer array {\tt A\%col}, and real array {\tt A\%val}, respectively. 
The same scheme is applicable to
$\bmH$ (thus requiring integer arrays {\tt H\%ptr}, {\tt H\%col}, and 
a real array {\tt H\%val}),
except that only the entries in the lower triangle need be stored.

For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than 
its predecessor.

\subsubsection{Diagonal storage format}\label{diagonal}
If $\bmH$ is diagonal (i.e., $h_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \neq j \leq n$)
only the diagonals entries $h_{ii}$, $1 \leq i \leq n$,  need be stored,
and the first $n$ components of the array {\tt H\%val} may be used for 
the purpose. There is no sensible equivalent for the non-square $\bmA$.

\subsubsection{Scaled-identity-matrix storage format}\label{scaled-identity}
If $\bmH$ is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix
(i.e., $h_{ii} = h_{11}$  and $h_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \neq j \leq n$)
only the first diagonal entry $h_{11}$ needs be stored,
and the first component of the array {\tt H\%val} may be used for
the purpose. Again, there is no sensible equivalent for the non-square $\bmA$.

\subsubsection{Identity-matrix storage format}\label{identity}
If $\bmH$ is the identity matrix
(i.e., $h_{ii} = 1$ and $h_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \neq j \leq n$),
no explicit entries needs be stored.

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding matrices}\label{typesmt}
The derived data type {\tt SMT\_TYPE} is used to hold the matrices $\bmA$
and $\bmH$. The components of {\tt SMT\_TYPE} used here are:

\begin{description}

\ittf{m} is a scalar component of type \integer, 
that holds the number of rows in the matrix. 
 
\ittf{n} is a scalar component of type \integer, 
that holds the number of columns in the matrix. 
 
\ittf{ne} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that
holds the number of matrix entries.

\ittf{type} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \character, that
is used to indicate the matrix storage scheme used. Its precise length and
content depends on the type of matrix to be stored (see \S\ref{typeprob}).

\ittf{val} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \realdp\, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that holds the values of the entries. 
Each pair of off-diagonal entries $h_{ij} = h_{ji}$ of a {\em symmetric}
matrix $\bmH$ is represented as a single entry 
(see \S\ref{dense}--\ref{rowwise}).
Any duplicated entries that appear in the sparse 
co-ordinate or row-wise schemes will be summed. 

\ittf{row} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the row indices of the entries. 
(see \S\ref{coordinate}).

\ittf{col} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the column indices of the entries
(see \S\ref{coordinate}--\ref{rowwise}).

\ittf{ptr} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt m + 1}, that may hold the pointers to
the first entry in each row (see \S\ref{rowwise}).

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%% problem type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding the problem}\label{typeprob}

 that holds the number of optimization variables, $n$.

 that holds the number of linear constraints, $m$.
              
\itt{Hessian\_kind} is a scalar variable of type \integer, 
that is used to indicate what type of Hessian the problem involves.
Possible values for {\tt Hessian\_kind} are:

\begin{description}
\itt{<0}  In this case, a general quadratic program of the form
\req{qp} is given. The Hessian matrix $\bmH$ will be provided in the 
component {\tt H} (see below).

\itt{0}  In this case, a linear program, that is a problem of the form 
\req{lsqp} with weights $\bmw = 0$, is given.

\itt{1} In this case, a least-distance problem of the form \req{lsqp}
with weights $w_{j} = 1$ for $j = 1, \ldots , n$ is given.

\itt{>1} In this case, a weighted least-distance problem of the form \req{lsqp}
with general weights $\bmw$ is given. The weights will be
provided in the component {\tt WEIGHT} (see below).
\end{description}
By default {\tt Hessian\_kind = - 1}.

\ittf{H} is scalar variable of type {\tt SMT\_TYPE} 
that holds the Hessian matrix $\bmH$. The following components
are used:

\begin{description}

\itt{H\%type} is an allocatable array of rank one and type default \character, 
that is used to indicate the storage scheme used. If the dense storage scheme 
(see Section~\ref{dense}) is used, 
the first five components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt DENSE}.
For the sparse co-ordinate scheme (see Section~\ref{coordinate}), 
the first ten components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt COORDINATE},  
for the sparse row-wise storage scheme (see Section~\ref{rowwise}),
the first fourteen components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS},
for the diagonal storage scheme (see Section~\ref{diagonal}),
the first eight components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt DIAGONAL},

(see Section~\ref{scaled-identity}),
the first fifteen components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt SCALED\_IDENTITY},
for the identity matrix storage scheme
(see Section~\ref{identity}), and
the first eight components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the

For convenience, the procedure {\tt SMT\_put} 
may be used to allocate sufficient space and insert the required keyword
into {\tt H\%type}.
For example, if {\tt prob} is of derived type {\tt \packagename\_problem\_type}
and involves a Hessian we wish to store using the co-ordinate scheme,
we may simply
%\vspace*{-2mm}
{\tt 
\begin{verbatim}
        CALL SMT_put( prob%H%type, 'COORDINATE', istat )
\end{verbatim}
}
%\vspace*{-4mm}
\noindent
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SMT} 
for further details on the use of {\tt SMT\_put}.

\itt{H\%ne} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that

\itt{H\%ptr} is a rank-one allocatable array of dimension {\tt n+1} and type 
\integer, that holds the starting position of 
each row of the {\bf lower triangular} part of $\bmH$, as well

scheme (see Section~\ref{rowwise}). It need not be allocated when the
other schemes are used.

\end{description}

should be allocated to have length {\tt n}, and its $j$-th component 
filled with the value $w_{j}$ for $j = 1, \ldots , n$, 
whenever {\tt Hessian\_kind} $>1$.
If {\tt Hessian\_kind} $\leq 1$, {\tt WEIGHT} need not be allocated.

\itt{target\_kind} is a scalar variable of type \integer, 
that is used to indicate whether the components of the targets $\bmx^0$ 
(if they are used) have special or general values. Possible values for 
{\tt target\_kind} are:
\begin{description}
\itt{0}  In this case, $\bmx^0 = 0$.

\itt{1} In this case, $x^0_{j} = 1$ for $j = 1, \ldots , n$.

\itt{$\neq$ 0,1} In this case, general values of $\bmx^0$ will be used,
     and will be provided in the component {\tt X0} (see below).
\end{description}
By default {\tt target\_kind = - 1}.

\ittf{X0} is a rank-one allocatable array type \realdp, that 
should be allocated to have length {\tt n}, and its $j$-th component 
filled with the value $x_{j}^0$ for $j = 1, \ldots , n$, 
whenever {\tt Hessian\_kind} $>0$ and {\tt target\_kind} $\neq 0,1$.
If {\tt Hessian\_kind} $\leq 0$ or {\tt target\_kind} $= 0,1$,
{\tt X0} need not be allocated.

\itt{gradient\_kind} is a scalar variable of type \integer, 
that is used to indicate whether the components of the gradient $\bmg$ 
have special or general values. Possible values for {\tt gradient\_kind} are:
\begin{description}
\itt{0}  In this case, $\bmg = 0$.

\itt{1} In this case, $g_{j} = 1$ for $j = 1, \ldots , n$.

\itt{$\neq$ 0,1} In this case, general values of $\bmg$ will be used,

\ittf{G} is a rank-one allocatable array of dimension {\tt n} and type 
\realdp, that holds the gradient $\bmg$ 
of the linear term of the quadratic objective function.
The $j$-th component of 
{\tt G}, $j = 1,  \ldots ,  n$, contains $\bmg_{j}$.
If {\tt gradient\_kind} {= 0, 1}, {\tt G} need not be allocated.

that holds the Jacobian matrix $\bmA$. The following components are used:

\begin{description}

\itt{A\%type} is an allocatable array of rank one and type default \character, that
is used to indicate the storage scheme used. If the dense storage scheme 
(see Section~\ref{dense}) is used, 
the first five components of {\tt A\%type} must contain the
string {\tt DENSE}.
For the sparse co-ordinate scheme (see Section~\ref{coordinate}), 
the first ten components of {\tt A\%type} must contain the
string {\tt COORDINATE}, while 
for the sparse row-wise storage scheme (see Section~\ref{rowwise}),
the first fourteen components of {\tt A\%type} must contain the
string {\tt SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS}.

Just as for {\tt H\%type} above, the procedure {\tt SMT\_put} 
may be used to allocate sufficient space and insert the required keyword
into {\tt A\%type}.
Once again, if {\tt prob} is of derived type {\tt \packagename\_problem\_type}
and involves a Jacobian we wish to store using the sparse row-wise 
storage scheme, we may simply
%\vspace*{-2mm}
{\tt 
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
}
%\vspace*{-4mm}

that holds the column indices of $\bmA$ in either the sparse co-ordinate 
(see Section~\ref{coordinate}), or the sparse row-wise 
(see Section~\ref{rowwise}) storage scheme.
It need not be allocated when the dense storage scheme is used.

There are three procedures for user calls
(see Section~\ref{galfeatures} for further features): 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The subroutine

\vspace*{-3mm}
\begin{description}
\ittf{p} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type

It is used to hold data about the problem being solved.
The user must have allocated all array components,

Users are free to choose whichever

The components {\tt p\%X} and {\tt p\%Y}

Inappropriate initial values will be altered, so the user should
not be overly concerned if suitable values are not apparent, and may be
content with merely setting {\tt p\%X=0.0} and {\tt p\%Y=0.0}.

On exit, the components {\tt p\%X} and {\tt p\%Y}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Warning and error messages %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galerrors
A negative value of {\tt inform\%status} on exit from 
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
or 
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}
indicates that an error has occurred. No further calls should be made
until the error has been corrected. Possible values are:

\begin{description}

\itt{\galerrallocate.} An allocation error occurred. 
A message indicating the offending 
array is written on unit {\tt control\%error}, and the returned allocation 
status and a string containing the name of the offending array
are held in {\tt inform\%alloc\_\-status}
and {\tt inform\%bad\_alloc} respectively.

\itt{\galerrdeallocate.} A deallocation error occurred. 
A message indicating the offending 
array is written on unit {\tt control\%error} and the returned allocation 
status and a string containing the name of the offending array
are held in {\tt inform\%alloc\_\-status}
and {\tt inform\%bad\_alloc} respectively.

\itt{\galerrrestrictions.} One of the restrictions 
{\tt prob\%n} $> 0$ or {\tt prob\%m} $\geq  0$
    or requirements that {\tt prob\%A\_type} 
    and {\tt prob\%H\_type} contain its relevant string
    {\tt 'DENSE'}, {\tt 'COORDINATE'}, {\tt 'SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS'}
    or {\tt 'DIAGONAL'}
    has been violated.

\itt{\galerrprimalinfeasible.} The constraints appear to be inconsistent.

\itt{\galerranalysis.} An error was reported by the subroutine 
{\tt SILS\_analyse} called by {\tt SBLS}. 
The return status from {\tt SILS\_analyse} is given in one of the
components of {\tt inform\%SBLS\_inform\%SLS\_inform}.
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SILS} for further details.

\itt{\galerrfactorization.} An error was reported by the subroutine 
{\tt SILS\_factorize}called by {\tt SBLS}. 
The return status from {\tt SILS\_factorize} is given in one of the
components of {\tt inform\%SBLS\_inform\%SLS\_inform}.
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SILS} for further details.

\itt{\galerrsolve.} An error was reported by the subroutine 
{\tt SILS\_solve} called by {\tt SBLS}.  
The return  status from {\tt SILS\_solve} is given in one of the
components of {\tt inform\%SBLS\_inform\%SLS\_inform}.
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SILS} for further details.

components of {\tt inform\%SBLS\_inform\%ULS\_inform}.
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt ULS} for further details.

\itt{\galerrpreconditioner.} The computed preconditioner has the 
wrong inertia and is thus unsuitable.

\itt{\galerrillconditioned.} The residuals from the preconditioning step 
are large, indicating that the factorization may be unsatisfactory.

\itt{\galerrinput.} {\tt \packagename\_resolve} has been called
before {\tt \packagename\_solve}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Further features %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galfeatures
\noindent In this section, we describe an alternative means of setting 
control parameters, that is components of the variable {\tt control} of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}), 
by reading an appropriate data specification file using the
subroutine {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}. This facility
is useful as it allows a user to change  {\tt \packagename} control parameters 
without editing and recompiling programs that call {\tt \packagename}.

A specification file, or specfile, is a data file containing a number of 
"specification commands". Each command occurs on a separate line, 
and comprises a "keyword", 
which is a string (in a close-to-natural language) used to identify a 
control parameter, and 
an (optional) "value", which defines the value to be assigned to the given
control parameter. All keywords and values are case insensitive, 
keywords may be preceded by one or more blanks but
values must not contain blanks, and
each value must be separated from its keyword by at least one blank.
Values must not contain more than 30 characters, and 
each line of the specfile is limited to 80 characters,
including the blanks separating keyword and value.



The portion of the specification file used by 
{\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
must start
with a "{\tt BEGIN \packagename}" command and end with an 
"{\tt END}" command.  The syntax of the specfile is thus defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  ( .. lines ignored by EQP_read_specfile .. )
    BEGIN EQP
       keyword    value
       .......    .....
       keyword    value
    END 
  ( .. lines ignored by EQP_read_specfile .. )
\end{verbatim}
where keyword and value are two strings separated by (at least) one blank.
The ``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiter command lines 
may contain additional (trailing) strings so long as such strings are 
separated by one or more blanks, so that lines such as
\begin{verbatim}
    BEGIN EQP SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
    END EQP SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
are acceptable. Furthermore, 
between the
``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiters,
specification commands may occur in any order.  Blank lines and
lines whose first non-blank character is {\tt !} or {\tt *} are ignored. 
The content 
of a line after a {\tt !} or {\tt *} character is also 
ignored (as is the {\tt !} or {\tt *}
character itself). This provides an easy manner to "comment out" some 
specification commands, or to comment specific values 
of certain control parameters.  

The value of a control parameters may be of three different types, namely
integer, logical or real.
Integer and real values may be expressed in any relevant Fortran integer and
floating-point formats (respectively). Permitted values for logical
parameters are "{\tt ON}", "{\tt TRUE}", "{\tt .TRUE.}", "{\tt T}", 
"{\tt YES}", "{\tt Y}", or "{\tt OFF}", "{\tt NO}",
"{\tt N}", "{\tt FALSE}", "{\tt .FALSE.}" and "{\tt F}". 
Empty values are also allowed for 
logical control parameters, and are interpreted as "{\tt TRUE}".  

The specification file must be open for 
input when {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
is called, and the associated device number 
passed to the routine in device (see below). 
Note that the corresponding 
file is {\tt REWIND}ed, which makes it possible to combine the specifications 
for more than one program/routine.  For the same reason, the file is not
closed by {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}.

Control parameters corresponding to the components 
{\tt SBLS\_control}
and
{\tt GLTR\_control} may be changed by including additional sections enclosed by
``{\tt BEGIN SBLS}'' and 
``{\tt END SBLS}'', and
``{\tt BEGIN GLTR}'' and 
``{\tt END GLTR}'', respectively. 
See the specification sheets for the packages 
{\tt \libraryname\_SBLS} 
and
{\tt \libraryname\_GLTR}
for further details.

\subsubsection{To read control parameters from a specification file}
\label{readspec}

Control parameters may be read from a file as follows:

\def\baselinestretch{0.8}

\begin{verbatim}
     CALL EQP_read_specfile( control, device )

\begin{description}
\itt{control} is a scalar \intentinout argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}). 
Default values should have already been set, perhaps by calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, individual components of {\tt control} may have been changed
according to the commands found in the specfile. Specfile commands and 
the component (see Section~\ref{typecontrol}) of {\tt control} 
that each affects are given in Table~\ref{specfile}.

\itt{device} is a scalar \intentin argument of type \integer,
that must be set to the unit number on which the specfile
has been opened. If {\tt device} is not open, {\tt control} will
not be altered and execution will continue, but an error message
will be printed on unit {\tt control\%error}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Information printed %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galinfo
If {\tt control\%print\_level} is positive, information about the progress 
of the algorithm will be printed on unit {\tt control\-\%out}.
If {\tt control\%print\_level} $= 1$, the norm of the
constraint violation and the value of the objective function 
for both the feasibility and optimality phases are reported.
Additionally, if {\tt control\%print\_level} $= 2$, 
{\tt print\_level = 1} output from both {\tt SBLS} and {\tt GLTR}
occurs, summarising the factorization and iteration phases, as
well as timing statistics from the two phases.
If {\tt control\%print\_level} $\geq 3$ detailed output from {\tt SBLS} 
and {\tt GLTR} occurs which is unlikely to be useful to general users.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% METHOD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmethod
Any finite solution $\bmx$ to the problem necessarily satisfies 
the primal optimality conditions
\eqn{pr}{\bmA \bmx + \bmc = \bmzero}
and the dual optimality conditions
\eqn{du}{
 \bmH \bmx + \bmg - \bmA^{T} \bmy = \bmzero,}
where the components of the vector $\bmy$ are 
known as the Lagrange multipliers for the constraints.

A solution to the problem is found in two phases.
In the first, a point $\bmx_F$ satisfying \req{pr} is found.
In the second, the required solution $\bmx = \bmx_F + \bms$
is determined by finding $\bms$ to minimize 
$q(\bms) = \half \bms^T \bmH \bms + \bmg_F^T \bms + f_F^{}$
subject to the homogeneous constraints $\bmA \bms = \bmzero$,
where $\bmg_F^{} = \bmH \bmx_F^{} + \bmg$ and 
$f_F^{} = \half \bmx_F^T \bmH \bmx_F^{} + \bmg^T \bmx_F^{} + f$.
The required constrained minimizer of $q(\bms)$ is obtained
by implictly applying the preconditioned conjugate-gradient method
in the null space of $\bmA$. Any preconditioner of the form
\disp{ \bmK_{G} = \mat{cc}{ \bmG & \bmA^T \\ \bmA  & 0 }}
is suitable, and the \galahad\ package {\tt SBLS}
provides a number of possibilities. In order to ensure that the
minimizer obtained is finite, an additional, precautionary trust-region
constraint $\|s\| \leq \Delta$ for some suitable positive radius 
$\Delta$ is imposed, and the \galahad\ package {\tt GLTR} is used to solve 
this additionally-constrained problem.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galexample
Suppose we wish to minimize
$\half x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \threehalves x_3^2 + 4 x_1 x_3 + 2 x_2 + 1$
subject to the the general linear constraints
$2 x_{1}  +  x_{2} - 2 = 0$ and
$x_{2} +  x_{3}  - 2 = 0$.
Then, on writing the data for this problem as
\disp{\bmH = \mat{ccc}{1 & & 4 \\ & 2 & \\ 4 &  & 3}, \;\;
 \bmg = \vect{ 0 \\ 2 \\ 0 }, \;\;
 \bmA = \mat{ccc}{ 2 & 1 & \\ & 1 & 1}
  \tim{and}
 \bmc = \vect{ -2 \\ -2 }}
in sparse co-ordinate format,
we may use the following code:

{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageexample}
}
\noindent
This produces the following output:
{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageresults}

The same problem may be solved holding the data in 
a sparse row-wise storage format by replacing the lines
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}

If instead $\bmH$ had been the diagonal matrix
\disp{\bmH = \mat{ccc}{1 & &   \\ & 0 & \\  &  & 3}}
but the other data is as before, the diagonal storage scheme 
might be used for $\bmH$, and in this case we would instead 
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
   CALL SMT_put( prob%H%type, 'DIAGONAL', s )  ! Specify dense storage for H
   ALLOCATE( p%H%val( n ) )
   p%H%val = (/ 1.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 3.0_wp /) ! Hessian values
