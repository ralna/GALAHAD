%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary

{\tt \fullpackagename} is a suite of Fortran~95 procedures 
for solving sparse unsymmetric system of linear equations. Given
a sparse matrix $\bmA = \{a_{ij}\}_{m \times n}$, this
subroutine solves the system $\bmA \bmx = \bmb$ (or optionally
$\bmA^T \bmx = \bmb$).
The matrix $\bmA$ can be rectangular. 

This Fortran 95 code offers additional features to the Fortran 77 HSL code 
{\tt MA33} which it calls. The storage required for the factorization is chosen
automatically and, if there is insufficient space for the factorization,
more space is allocated and the factorization is repeated.  The package
also returns the number of entries in the factors and has facilities
for identifying the rows and columns that are treated specially 
when the matrix is singular or rectangular.

\galremark {\tt GALAHAD\_\packagename} is a Fortran 95 encapsulation of 
the core subroutines from the HSL Fortran 77 package {\tt MA33} and offers some 
additional facilities.  The user interface is designed to be
equivalent to a subset of the more recent HSL package {\tt HSL\_MA48}, 
so many features of the two packages may be used interchangeably.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO USE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galhowto

The package is available using both single and double precision reals, 
and either 32-bit or 64-bit integers. Access to the 32-bit integer,
single precision version requires the {\tt USE} statement
\medskip

\hspace{8mm} {\tt USE \fullpackagename\_single}

\medskip
\noindent
with the obvious substitution {\tt \fullpackagename\_double},
{\tt \fullpackagename\_single\_64} and 
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double\_64} for the other variants.

\noindent
If it is required to use more than one of the modules at the same time, 
the derived types
(Section~\ref{galtypes})
and the subroutines
(Section~\ref{galarguments})
must be renamed on one of the {\tt USE} statements.

There are four principal subroutines for user calls:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The subroutine {\tt \packagename\_INITIALIZE} must be 
called to initialize the
structure for the factors. It may also be called to set default values
for the components of the control structure. If non-default values are
wanted for any of the control components, the corresponding components
should be altered after the call to {\tt \packagename\_INITIALIZE}.
 
\item {\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE} accepts the pattern of $A$ and chooses
pivots for Gaussian elimination using a selection criterion to preserve
sparsity.  It will optionally find an ordering to block triangular form
and exploit that structure. An option exists to restrict pivoting to the
diagonal, which might reduce fill-in and operations if the matrix has a
symmetric structure. It is possible to perform an analysis without
generating the factors, in which case data on the costs of a subsequent
factorization are returned to the user.  It is also possible to request
that a set of columns are pivoted on last in which case a subsequent
factorization can avoid factorization operations on the earlier columns.

\item {\tt \packagename\_SOLVE} uses the factors generated by 
{\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE} to
solve a system of equations $\bmA \bmx = \bmb$ or $\bmA^T \bmx = \bmb$.

\item {\tt \packagename\_FINALIZE} reallocates the arrays held inside
the structure for the factors to have size zero. It should be called
when all the systems involving its matrix have been solved unless the
structure is about to be used for the factors of another matrix.

\end{enumerate}

\noindent There is an auxiliary subroutine for user calls after a 
successful factorization:

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}

\item {\tt \packagename\_SPECIAL\_ROWS\_AND\_COLS} identifies the rows
and columns that are treated specially when the matrix is singular or
rectangular.  It is for use following a call of {\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE}.

\end{enumerate}

\input{kinds}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% derived types %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galtypes
Six derived data types are accessible from the package.

%%%%%%%%%%% problem type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding the matrix}\label{typemat}
The derived data type {\tt SMT\_TYPE} is used to hold 
the matrix. The components of {\tt SMT\_TYPE} used are:

\begin{description}

\itt{M} is an \integer\ scalar which holds the number of rows $m$ of
   the matrix $A$.
\restriction {\tt M} $\geq$ {\tt 1}.

\itt{N} is an \integer\ scalar which holds the number of columns {n}
   of the matrix $A$.
\restriction {\tt N} $\geq$ {\tt 1}.

\itt{NE} is an \integer\ scalar which holds the  number of matrix entries.  
\restriction {\tt NE} $\geq$ {\tt 0}.

\itt{VAL} is a \realdp\  pointer array of length at least {\tt NE},
the leading part of which holds the values of the entries.
Duplicate entries are summed.

\itt{ROW} is an \integer\  pointer array of length at least {\tt NE},
the leading part of which holds the row indices of the entries.

\itt{COL} is an \integer\  pointer array of length at least {\tt NE},
the leading part of which holds the column indices of the entries.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%% control type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding control 
 parameters}\label{typecontrol}
The derived data type 
{\tt \packagename\_CONTROL} 
is used to hold controlling data. Default values may be obtained by calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
(see Section~\ref{subinit}). The components of 
{\tt \packagename\_CONTROL} 
are:

\begin{description}

\itt{LP} is an \integer\ scalar used by the subroutines as the output
 unit for error messages.  If it is negative, these
 messages will be suppressed.  The default value is {\tt 6}.

\itt{WP} is an \integer\ scalar used by the subroutines as the output
 unit for warning messages.  If it is negative, these messages 
 will be suppressed.  The default value is {\tt 6}.

\itt{MP} is an \integer\ scalar used by the subroutines as the output
 unit for diagnostic printing.  If it is negative, these messages 
 will be suppressed.  The default value is {\tt 6}.

\itt{LDIAG} is an \integer\ scalar used by the subroutines to control
 diagnostic printing.  If {\tt LDIAG} is less than {\tt 1}, no messages will
 be output. If the value is {\tt 1}, only error messages will
 be printed.  If the value is {\tt 2}, then error and warning messages will
 be printed. If the value is {\tt 3}, scalar data and a few
 entries of array data on entry and exit from each subroutine will be
 printed.  If the value is greater than {\tt 3}, all data will be printed on 
 entry and exit.  This output comes from the Fortran 77 {\tt MA33} routines
 called by {\tt GALAHAD\_\packagename}. The default value is {\tt 2}.

\itt{LA} is an \integer\ scalar used by {\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE}. 
{\tt LA} is set to
{\tt FILL\_IN} $\ast$ {\tt NE} by {\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE}. The default for
{\tt FILL\_IN} is {\tt 3} but, if the user knows that 
there may be significant fill-in during factorization, it may be efficient 
to increase this value.

\itt{MAXLA} is an \integer\ scalar used by {\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE}. An error
return occurs if the real array that holds data for the factors is too
small and reallocating it to have size changed by the factor {\tt MULTIPLIER
would} make its size greater than {\tt MAXLA}. The default value is
{\tt HUGE(0)}.

\itt{MULTIPLIER} is a \realdp\ scalar used by {\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE} when a
real or integer array that holds data for the factors is too small. The
array is reallocated with its size changed by the factor {\tt MULTIPLIER}.
The default value is {\tt 2.0}.

\itt{REDUCE} is a \realdp\ scalar that reduces the size of previously allocated
internal workspace arrays if they are larger than currently required
by a factor of {\tt REDUCE} or more. The default value is {\tt 2.0}.

\itt{SWITCH} is an \realdp\ scalar used by {\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE} to 
control
the switch from sparse to full matrix processing when factorizing
the diagonal blocks.  The switch is made when the ratio of
number of entries in the reduced matrix to the number that it would
have as a full matrix is greater than {\tt SWITCH}.
A value greater than {\tt 1.0} is treated as {\tt 1.0}.
The default value is {\tt 0.5}.

\itt{U} is a \realdp\ scalar that is used by  {\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE}.
It holds the threshold parameter for the pivot control.
The default value is {\tt 0.01}.  For problems requiring greater
than average numerical care a higher value than the default would be
advisable. Values greater than {\tt 1.0} are treated as {\tt 1.0} and 
less than {\tt 0.0} as {\tt 0.0}.

\itt{DROP} is a \realdp\ scalar that is used by {\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE}.
Any entry whose modulus is less than
{\tt DROP} will be dropped from the factorization.
The factorization will then
require less storage but will be inaccurate.
The default value is {\tt 0.0}.

\itt{TOLERANCE} is a \realdp\ scalar that is used by {\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE}.
If it is set to a positive value,
any pivot whose modulus is less than
{\tt TOLERANCE} will be treated as zero. 
% If the matrix is rectangular or rank deficient,
% it is possible that
% entries with modulus less than {\tt TOLERANCE} are dropped from 
the factorization.
The default value is {\tt 0.0}.

\itt{CGCE} is a \realdp\ scalar that is used by {\tt \packagename\_SOLVE}.
It is used to
monitor the convergence of the iterative refinement.  If successive
corrections do not decrease by a factor of at least {\tt CGCE},
convergence is deemed to be too slow and {\tt \packagename\_SOLVE
terminates} with {\tt SINFO\%FLAG} set to -{\tt 8}.
The default value is {\tt 0.5}.

\itt{PIVOTING} is a \integer\ scalar that is used to control numerical
pivoting by {\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE}. If {\tt PIVOTING} has a positive value,
each pivot search is limited to a maximum of {\tt PIVOTING
columns.}  If {\tt PIVOTING} is set to the value {\tt 0}, a full Markowitz search
technique is used to find the best pivot.  This is usually only a
little slower, but can occasionally be very slow.  It may result in
reduced fill-in. The default value is {\tt 3}.

\itt{DIAGONAL\_PIVOTING} is a \logical\ scalar used by 
{\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE} to
limit pivoting to the diagonal.  It will do so if {\tt DIAGONAL\_PIVOTING} is set
to \true.  Its default value is \false.

\itt{FILL\_IN} is an \integer\ scalar used by {\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE}
to determine the
initial storage allocation for the matrix factors.  It will be set to
{\tt FILL\_IN} times the value of {\tt MATRIX\%NE}.  
The default value is {\tt 3}.

\itt{BTF} is an \integer\ scalar used by {\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE} to define
the minimum size of a block of the block triangular form
other than the final block.  If block triangularization is not wanted,
{\tt BTF} should be set to a value greater than or equal to
{\tt MAX(M,N)}. Block triangulation will only be attempted for square
({\tt M} $=$ {\tt N}) matrices.
A non-positive value is regarded as the value {\tt 1}.  For further
discussion of this variable, see Section~\ref{secbtf}.
The default value is {\tt 1}.

\itt{STRUCT} is a \logical\ scalar used by 
{\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE}. If {\tt STRUCT} is
set to \true, the subroutine will exit immediately structural 
singularity is detected.  The default value is \false.

\itt{FACTOR\_BLOCKING} is an \integer\ scalar used by 
{\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE} to determine
the block size used for the Level {\tt 3} {\tt BLAS} within the full
factorization.  If it is set to {\tt 1}, Level 1 BLAS is used, if to {\tt 2},
Level 2 BLAS is used.  The default value is {\tt 32}.

\itt{SOLVE\_BLAS} is an \integer\ scalar used by {\tt \packagename\_SOLVE} to
determine whether Level {\tt 2} {\tt BLAS} is used ({\tt SOLVE\_BLAS}
$> 1$) or not ({\tt SOLVE\_BLAS} $\leq 1$). The default value is {\tt 2}.

\itt{MAXIT} is an \integer\ scalar used by {\tt \packagename\_SOLVE} to limit
the number of refinement iterations.  If {\tt MAXIT} is set to zero then
{\tt \packagename\_SOLVE} will not perform any error analysis or 
iterative refinement.
The default value is {\tt 10}.

 of the internal data structure performed by {\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE.
} If {\tt NCMPA} is fairly large (say greater than 10), performance may be
 very poor.

non-triangular block on the diagonal of the block triangular form.
If the matrix is rectangular, {\tt LBLOCK} will hold the number of rows.

\subsection{Rectangular and rank deficient matrices}

Rectangular matrices are handled by the code although no attempt is made
at prior block triangularization.  Rank deficient matrices are also factorized
and a warning flag is set ({\tt AINFO\%FLAG} or {\tt FINFO\%FLAG} set to 
{\tt 4}).
If {\tt CONTROL\%STRUCT} is set to \true,
then an error return occurs ({\tt AINFO\%FLAG} = {\tt -5}) if block
triangularization is attempted and the matrix is structurally singular.

 The package identifies a square submatrix of $\bmA$ that it considers
to be nonsingular. When solving $\bmA \bmx = \bmb$, equations outside
this submatrix are ignored and solution components that correspond to
columns outside the submatrix are set to zero. {\tt
\packagename\_SPECIAL\_ROWS\_AND\_COLS} identifies the rows and columns
of this submatrix from stored integer data.

It should be emphasized that the primary purpose of the 
package is to solve square nonsingular sets of equations. The
rank is determined from the number of pivots that are not small or zero. 
There are more reliable (but much more expensive) ways of determining 
numerical rank.

\subsection{Block upper triangular form} \label{secbtf}

Many large unsymmetric matrices can be permuted to the form
\disp{\bmP \bmA \bmQ = \mat{cccccc}{
\bmA_{11} & \bmA_{12} & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
          & \bmA_{22} & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
          & & \bmA_{33} & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
          & & & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\
          & & & & \cdot & \cdot \\
          & & & & & \bmA_{\ell\ell} }}
\noindent whereupon the system
\disp{\bmA \bmx = \bmb \;\; (\mbox{or}\;\; \bmA^T \bmx = \bmb)}
can be solved by block back-substitution
giving a saving in storage and execution time if the matrices $\bmA_{ii}$
are much smaller than $\bmA$.

\noindent Since it is not very efficient to process a small block (for example
a {1 by 1} block), any block of size less than {\tt CONTROL\%BTF} other than the
final block is merged with its successor. 

\subsection{Badly-scaled systems}

If the user's input matrix has entries differing widely in
magnitude, then an inaccurate solution may be obtained. In such cases,
the user is advised to first use the HSL package {\tt MC29A/AD} to 
obtain scaling factors for the matrix and then explicitly scale it prior 
to calling this package.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% METHOD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmethod

A version of sparse Gaussian elimination is used.
Subroutine {\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE} calls {\tt MA33A/AD}
to compute a pivot ordering for the decomposition of {$A$} into 
sparse $LU$ factors. Pivoting is used to preserve sparsity in the 
factors. Each pivot $a_{pj}$ is required to satisfy a stability test
\disp{|a_{pj}| \geq u \max_i | a_{ij}|}
\noindent within the reduced matrix, where $u$ is the threshold held in
{\tt CONTROL\%U}, with default value {\tt 0.01}.  The subroutine 
then computes the numerical factors based on the chosen pivot order.
Subroutine {\tt \packagename\_SOLVE} uses the factors found by 
{\tt \packagename\_ANALYSE} to solve systems of equations by 
calling {\tt MA33C/CD}.

A discussion of the design of the predecessor to the {\tt MA33} routines 
called by this package is given by 
Duff and Reid, {\it ACM Trans Math Software} {\bf 5},  1979, pp 18-35.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galexample

We illustrate the use of the package on the solution of the 
set of equations 
\disp{\mat{ccc}{ 11 & 12 &   \\
                 21 & 22 & 23  \\
                    & 32 & 33 } \bmx =
       \vect{23 \\ 66 \\ 65}}
and a second set
\disp{\mat{ccc}{ 11 & 21 &   \\
                 12 & 22 & 32  \\
                    & 23 & 33 } \bmx =
       \vect{32 \\ 66 \\ 56}}
involving the transpose
(note that this example does not illustrate all the facilities). 
Then we may use the following code:
{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageexample}
}
\noindent
%with the following data
%{\tt \small
%\VerbatimInput{\packagedata}
