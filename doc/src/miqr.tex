%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary
Given a real matrix $m$ by $n$ matrix $\bmA$, form a multilevel 
incomplete QR factorization $\bmQ \bmR$ so that $\bmA \approx \bmQ\bmR$ or
optionally $\bmA^T \approx \bmQ\bmR$.
Only the $n$ by $n$ triangular factor $\bmR$ is retained, and facilities
are provided to allow the solutions of the systems $\bmR \bmu = \bmv$ and 
$\bmR^T \bmx = \bmz$
for given vectors $\bmv$ and $\bmz$. The matrix $\bmR$ is particularly helpful
as a preconditioner when applying an iterative method to solve the
least-squares problems $\min \|\bmA\bmx-\bmb\|_2$ or 
$\min \|\bmA^T\bmy-\bmc\|_2$.
Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrices $\bmA$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% matrix formats %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmatrix
The input matrix $\bmA$ may be stored in a variety of input formats.

\subsubsection{Dense storage format}\label{dense}
The matrix $\bmA$ is stored as a compact 
dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
Component $n \ast (i-1) + j$ of the storage array {\tt A\%val} will hold the 
value $a_{ij}$ for $i = 1, \ldots , m$, $j = 1, \ldots , n$.

\subsubsection{Sparse co-ordinate storage format}\label{coordinate}
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored. For the 
$l$-th entry of $\bmA$, its row index $i$, column index $j$ 
and value $a_{ij}$
are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer arrays {\tt A\%row}, 
{\tt A\%col} and real array {\tt A\%val}, respectively.
The order is unimportant, but the total
number of entries {\tt A\%ne} is also required. 

\subsubsection{Sparse row-wise storage format}\label{rowwise}
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in row $i$ appear directly before those
in row $i+1$. For the $i$-th row of $\bmA$, the $i$-th component of a 
integer array {\tt A\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while {\tt A\%ptr} $(m+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices $j$ and values $a_{ij}$ of the entries in the $i$-th row 
are stored in components 
$l =$ {\tt A\%ptr}$(i)$, \ldots , {\tt A\%ptr} $(i+1)-1$ of the 
integer array {\tt A\%col}, and real array {\tt A\%val}, respectively. 

\subsubsection{Sparse column-wise storage format}\label{colwise}
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in column $j$ appear directly before those
in column $j+1$. For the $j$-th column of $\bmA$, the $j$-th component of a 
integer array {\tt A\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this column,
while {\tt A\%ptr} $(n+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The row indices $i$ and values $a_{ij}$ of the entries in the $j$-th row 
are stored in components 
$l =$ {\tt A\%ptr}$(j)$, \ldots , {\tt A\%ptr} $(j+1)-1$ of the 
integer array {\tt A\%row}, and real array {\tt A\%val}, respectively. 

For sparse matrices, the row and column schemes almost always requires 
less storage than the coordinate and dense schemes.

\galtypes
Five derived data types are accessible from the package.

%%%%%%%%%%% matrix data type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding matrices}\label{typesmt}
The derived data type {\tt SMT\_TYPE} is used to hold the matrix $\bmA$.
The components of {\tt SMT\_TYPE} used here are:

\begin{description}

\ittf{m} is a scalar component of type \integer, 
that holds the number of rows in the matrix. 
 
\ittf{n} is a scalar component of type \integer, 
that holds the number of columns in the matrix. 
 
\ittf{type} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \character, that
is used to indicate the storage scheme used. If the dense storage scheme 
(see \S\ref{dense}), is used, 
the first five components of {\tt type} must contain the
string {\tt DENSE}.
For the sparse co-ordinate scheme (see \S\ref{coordinate}), 
the first ten components of {\tt type} must contain the
string {\tt COORDINATE}, 
for the sparse row-wise storage scheme (see \S\ref{rowwise}),
the first fourteen components of {\tt type} must contain the
string {\tt SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS}, and
for the sparse column-wise storage scheme (see \S\ref{colwise}),
the first seventeen components of {\tt type} must contain the
string {\tt SPARSE\_BY\_COLUMNS}.

For convenience, the procedure {\tt SMT\_put} 
may be used to allocate sufficient space and insert the required keyword
into {\tt type}.
For example, if {\tt A} is of derived type {\tt SMT\_type}
and we wish to use the co-ordinate storage scheme, we may simply
%\vspace*{-2mm}
{\tt 
\begin{verbatim}
        CALL SMT_put( A%type, 'COORDINATE', istat )
\end{verbatim}
}
%\vspace*{-4mm}
\noindent
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SMT} 
for further details on the use of {\tt SMT\_put}.

\ittf{ne} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that
holds the number of matrix entries.

\ittf{val} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \realdp\, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that holds the values of the entries. 
Any duplicated entries that appear in the sparse 
co-ordinate or row-wise schemes will be summed. 

\ittf{row} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the row indices of the entries. 
(see \S\ref{coordinate} and \S\ref{colwise}).

\ittf{col} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the column indices of the entries
(see \S\ref{coordinate}--\ref{rowwise}).

\ittf{ptr} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt m + 1}, that may hold the pointers to
the first entry in each row (see \S\ref{rowwise}) or of dimension
at least {\tt n + 1}, that may hold the pointers to
the first entry in each column (see \S\ref{colwise}).

\end{description}


%%%%%%%%%%% control type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding control 
 parameters}\label{typecontrol}
The derived data type 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type} 
is used to hold controlling data. Default values may be obtained by calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
(see \S\ref{subinit}),
while components may also be changed by calling

(see \S\ref{readspec}). 
The components of 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type} 
are:

\begin{description}

\itt{error} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that holds the

to control the amount of informational output which is required. No 
informational output will occur if {\tt print\_level} $\leq 0$. If

level of the process. If {\tt print\_level} $\geq 2$, this output will be
increased to provide significant detail of the factorization.
The default is {\tt print\_level = 0}.

needed to store $\bmR$ and other intermediary data. 
The default is {\tt buffer = 70}.

\itt{smallest\_diag} is a scalar variable of type \realdp, that is used
to identify those diagonal entries of $\bmR$ that are considered to be zero
(and thus indicate rank deficiency). Any diagonal entry in the $\bmR$
factor that is smaller than {\tt smallest\_dia} will be judged to be zero, 
and modified accordingly.
The default is {\tt smallest\_diag = }$10^{-10}$.

\itt{tol\_level} is a scalar variable of type \realdp, that is used
as a tolerance for stopping multi-level phase. In particular, the
multi-level phase ends if the dimension of the reduced problem 
is no smaller that {\tt tol\_level} times that of the previous
reduced problem.
The default is {\tt tol\_level = 0.3}.

\itt{tol\_orthogonal} is a scalar variable of type \realdp, 
that is used to judge if two vectors are roughly orthogonal; specifically
vectors $u$ and $v$ are orthogonal if $|u^T v| \leq$ {\tt tol\_orthogonal} 
$\ast \|u\| \|v\|$.
The default is {\tt tol\_orthogonal = 0.0}.

\itt{tol\_orthogonal\_increase} is a scalar variable of type \realdp, 
that is used to indicate the increase in the orthogonality tolerance 
that will be applied at each successive level.
The default is {\tt tol\_orthogonal\_increase = 0.01}.

\itt{average\_max\_fill} is a scalar variable of type \realdp, that 
is used to control the incomplete factorization. In particular
 the maximum number of elements allowed in each column of $\bmR$ will not exceed
{\tt average\_max\_fill} {\tt * ne / n}.

{\tt average\_max\_fill\_q} {\tt * ne / m}.
The default is {\tt average\_max\_fill\_q = 24.0}.

\itt{tol\_drop} is a scalar variable of type \realdp, that is used
as a dropping tolerance for small generated entries. Any entry smaller
than  {\tt tol\_drop} will be excluded from the factorization.
The default is {\tt tol\_drop = 0.01}.

\itt{transpose} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that is used
to indicate whether the factorization of $\bmA^T$ should be found rather
than that of $\bmA$. 
The default is {\tt transpose = .FALSE.}.

\itt{multi\_level} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that is used
to specify whether a multi-level incomplete factorization (MIQR) will be 
attempted or whether an incomplete QR factorization (IQR) suffices.
The default is {\tt multi\_level = .TRUE.}.

\itt{sort} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that is used
to specify whether the nodes of the graph of $\bmA^T \bmA$ should be sorted
in order of increasing degree. This often improves the quality of the
multilevel factorization. 
The default is {\tt sort = .TRUE.}.

\itt{deallocate\_after\_factorization} is a scalar variable of type default 
\logical, that is used to specify whether temporary workspace 
should be deallocated after every factorization. This may save space
at the expense of multiple allocations if many factorizations are required.
The default is {\tt deallocate\_after\_factorization = .FALSE.}.

\itt{space\_critical} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, 
that must be set \true\ if space is critical when allocating arrays
and  \false\ otherwise. The package may run faster if 
{\tt space\_critical} is \false\ but at the possible expense of a larger
storage requirement. The default is {\tt space\_critical = .FALSE.}.

\itt{deallocate\_error\_fatal} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, 
that must be set \true\ if the user wishes to terminate execution if
a deallocation  fails, and \false\ if an attempt to continue
will be made. The default is {\tt deallocate\_error\_fatal = .FALSE.}.

\itt{prefix} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 30, that may be used to provide a user-selected 
character string to preface every line of printed output. 
Specifically, each line of output will be prefaced by the string 
{\tt prefix(2:LEN(TRIM(prefix))-1)},
thus ignoring the first and last non-null components of the
supplied string. If the user does not want to preface lines by such
a string, they may use the default {\tt prefix = ""}.

\itt{CONVERT\_control} is a scalar variable of type 
{\tt CONVERT\_control\_type}
whose components are used to control the conversion of the
input matrix type into the column-wise scheme used internally
by  {\tt \fullpackagename}, as performed by the package 
{\tt \libraryname\_CONVERT}. 
See the specification sheet for the package 
{\tt \libraryname\_CONVERT} 
for details, and appropriate default values.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Further features %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galfeatures
\noindent In this section, we describe an alternative means of setting 
control parameters, that is components of the variable {\tt control} of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see \S\ref{typecontrol}), 
by reading an appropriate data specification file using the
subroutine {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}. This facility
is useful as it allows a user to change  {\tt \packagename} control parameters 
without editing and recompiling programs that call {\tt \packagename}.

A specification file, or specfile, is a data file containing a number of 
"specification commands". Each command occurs on a separate line, 
and comprises a "keyword", 
which is a string (in a close-to-natural language) used to identify a 
control parameter, and 
an (optional) "value", which defines the value to be assigned to the given
control parameter. All keywords and values are case insensitive, 
keywords may be preceded by one or more blanks but
values must not contain blanks, and
each value must be separated from its keyword by at least one blank.
Values must not contain more than 30 characters, and 
each line of the specfile is limited to 80 characters,
including the blanks separating keyword and value.



The portion of the specification file used by 
{\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
must start
with a "{\tt BEGIN \packagename}" command and end with an 
"{\tt END}" command.  The syntax of the specfile is thus defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  ( .. lines ignored by MIQR_read_specfile .. )
    BEGIN MIQR
       keyword    value
       .......    .....
       keyword    value
    END 
  ( .. lines ignored by MIQR_read_specfile .. )
\end{verbatim}
where keyword and value are two strings separated by (at least) one blank.
The ``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiter command lines 
may contain additional (trailing) strings so long as such strings are 
separated by one or more blanks, so that lines such as
\begin{verbatim}
    BEGIN MIQR SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
    END MIQR SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
are acceptable. Furthermore, 
between the
``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiters,
specification commands may occur in any order.  Blank lines and
lines whose first non-blank character is {\tt !} or {\tt *} are ignored. 
The content 
of a line after a {\tt !} or {\tt *} character is also 
ignored (as is the {\tt !} or {\tt *}
character itself). This provides an easy manner to "comment out" some 
specification commands, or to comment specific values 
of certain control parameters.  

The value of a control parameters may be of three different types, namely
integer, logical or real.
Integer and real values may be expressed in any relevant Fortran integer and
floating-point formats (respectively). Permitted values for logical
parameters are "{\tt ON}", "{\tt TRUE}", "{\tt .TRUE.}", "{\tt T}", 
"{\tt YES}", "{\tt Y}", or "{\tt OFF}", "{\tt NO}",
"{\tt N}", "{\tt FALSE}", "{\tt .FALSE.}" and "{\tt F}". 
Empty values are also allowed for 
logical control parameters, and are interpreted as "{\tt TRUE}".  

The specification file must be open for 
input when {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
is called, and the associated device number 
passed to the routine in device (see below). 
Note that the corresponding 
file is {\tt REWIND}ed, which makes it possible to combine the specifications 
for more than one program/routine.  For the same reason, the file is not
closed by {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}.

Control parameters may be read from a file as follows:

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentinout argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see \S\ref{typecontrol}). 
Default values should have already been set, perhaps by calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, individual components of {\tt control} may have been changed
according to the commands found in the specfile. Specfile commands and 
the component (see \S\ref{typecontrol}) of {\tt control} 
that each affects are given in Table~\ref{specfile}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% METHOD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmethod

Given the matrix $\bmA$, a decomposition
\disp{ \bmA \approx \bmQ_0 \mat{cc}{ \bmR_0 & \bmS_0 \\ & \bmA_1}}
is found. Here $\bmR_0$ is upper triangular and 
$\bmQ_0$ is constructed as normalized,
structurally-orthogonal columns of $\bmA$, or columns that are approximately
so. The same approach is then applied
recursively to $\bmA_1$ to obtain $\bmR_1$ and $\bmA_2$, etc. The
recursion ends either before or at a prescribed level $k$, and thereafter
an incomplete QR factorization of the remaining block $\bmA_k$ is computed.

\noindent
The basic algorithm is a slight generalisation of that given by

Na Li and Yousef Saad (2006).
MIQR: A Multilevel Incomplete QR preconditioner for large sparse 
least-squares problems.
SIAM. J. Matrix Anal. \& Appl., {\bf 28}(2) 524--550,

\noindent
and follows in many aspects the design of the C package

%\noindent
\url{http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~saad/software/MIQR.tar.gz}

\noindent
The principal use of $\bmR$ is as a preconditioner when solving
linear least-squares problems via an iterative method. In particular,
the minimizer of $\|\bmA\bmx-\bmb\|_2$ satisfies the normal equations
$\bmA^T \bmA \bmx = \bmA^T \bmb$, and if $\bmA = \bmQ \bmR$
with orthogobal $\bmQ$, it follows
that we may find $\bmx$ by forward and back substitution from
$\bmR^T \bmR \bmx = \bmA^T \bmb$. Moreover 
$\bmR^{-T} \bmA^T \bmA \bmR^{-1} = \bmI$, 
the $n$ by $n$ identity matrix. Since the matrix $\bmR$
computed by {\tt \packagename} is incomplete, we expect instead that
$\bmR^{-T} \bmA^T \bmA \bmR^{-1} \approx \bmI$, and this may be used
to advantage by iterative methods like CGNE and LSQR. See \$2.5 of
the specification sheets for the packages
{\tt \libraryname\_LSTR},
{\tt \libraryname\_LSRT} 
and 
{\tt \libraryname\_L2RT} for uses within \galahad.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galexample
Suppose 
\disp{ \bmA = \mat{ccc}{ 1 & 2 & \\ 3 & & \\ & 4 & \\ & & 5 },}
that we wish to form a multi-level incomplete factorization of $\bmA$,
and then to solve the resulting systems 
\disp{ \bmR^T \bmz = \bmb \tim{and} \bmR \bmx = \bmz, \tim{where}
\bmb = \vect{14 \\ 42 \\ 75}.}
Then storing the matrices in sparse row format,
we may use the following code:

{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageexample}
}
\noindent
This produces the following output:
{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageresults}
}
\noindent
The same problem may be solved holding the data in 
a sparse column-wise storage format by replacing the lines
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
! sparse row-wise storage format
...
! problem data complete   
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
by
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
! sparse column-wise storage format
   CALL SMT_put( A%type, 'SPARSE_BY_COLUMNS', i ) ! storage for A
   ALLOCATE( A%val( A%ne ), A%row( A%ne ), A%ptr( A%n + 1 ) )
   A%val = (/ 1.0_wp, 3.0_wp, 2.0_wp, 4.0_wp, 5.0_wp /) ! matrix A
   A%row = (/ 1, 2, 1, 3, 4 /)
   A%ptr = (/ 1, 3, 5, 6 /)                      ! set column pointers  
! problem data complete   
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
or using a sparse co-ordinate storage format with the replacement lines
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
!  sparse co-ordinate storage format
   CALL SMT_put( A%type, 'COORDINATE', i ) ! storage for A
   ALLOCATE( A%val( A%ne ), A%row( A%ne ), A%col( A%ne ) )
   A%val = (/ 1.0_wp, 2.0_wp, 3.0_wp, 4.0_wp, 5 /) ! matrix A
   A%row = (/ 1, 1, 2, 3, 4 /)
   A%col = (/ 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 /)
! problem data complete   
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
or using a dense storage format with the replacement lines
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
! dense storage format
   CALL SMT_put( A%type, 'DENSE', i )  ! storage for A
   ALLOCATE( A%val( A%n * A%m ) )
   A%val = (/ 1.0_wp, 2.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 3.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 4.0_wp, &
              0.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 5.0_wp /) ! matrix A, dense by rows
! problem data complete
