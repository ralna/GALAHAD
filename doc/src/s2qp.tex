%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary

This package uses a {\bf trust-region/linesearch hybrid method to find
  a (local) constrained minimizer} of the following optimization
  problem:
\eqn{prob}{
   \begin{tabular*}{5in}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}c@{\extracolsep{0pt}}ll%
                            @{\extracolsep{\fill}}c}
         & $\minimize{\bmx\in\smallRe^n}$&\quad& $f(\bmx)$ &$$ \\ [3pt]
         &  $\subject$        &     &  $\bmc_\ell \leq c(\bmx) \leq \bmc_u$ & \\
         &                    &     &  $\bma_\ell \leq \bmA \bmx \leq \bma_u$ & \\
         &                    &     &  $\bmx_\ell \leq \bmx \leq \bmx_u$
   \end{tabular*}
 } where $f : \Re^n \into \Re$ is a differentiable objective function,
 $c : \Re^n \into \Re^m$ is a differentiable \emph{general} constraint
 function, $\bmA$ is an $\Re^{m_a}$ by $\Re^n$ \emph{linear} constraint
 matrix , $\bmc_\ell$ and $\bmc_u$ are vectors in $\Re^m$ of upper and lower
 bounds for the general constraints $c(\bmx)$, $\bma_\ell$ and $\bma_u$ are
 vectors in $\Re^{m_a}$ of upper and lower bounds for the linear
 constraints $\bmA\bmx$, and $\bmx_\ell$ and $\bmx_u$ are vectors in $\Re^n$ of
 upper and lower bounds on the variables $\bmx$.  First derivatives
 are required and second derivatives may be exploited when they can be
 calculated---if the product of first and/or second derivative matrices with a vector may
 be found but not the derivatives themselves, then this may also be
 exploited.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO USE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galhowto

The package is available using both single and double precision reals, 
and either 32-bit or 64-bit integers. Access to the 32-bit integer,
single precision version requires the {\tt USE} statement
\medskip

\hspace{8mm} {\tt USE \fullpackagename\_single}

\medskip
\noindent
with the obvious substitution {\tt \fullpackagename\_double},
{\tt \fullpackagename\_single\_64} and 
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double\_64} for the other variants.

\noindent
If it is required to use more than one of the modules at the same time, 
the derived types
{\tt NLPT\_type}, {\tt S2QP\_control\_type}, {\tt S2QP\_data\_type}, 
{\tt S2QP\_inform\_type} (Section~\ref{galtypes})
and the subroutines {\tt S2QP\_initialize}, {\tt S2QP\_solve}, and
{\tt S2QP\_terminate} (Section~\ref{galarguments}) must be renamed on
one of the {\tt USE} statements.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% matrix storage formats %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmatrix The $m$ by $n$ general constraint Jacobian $\bmJ \eqdef
\Grad c(\bmx)$, the $m_a$ by $n$ linear constraint matrix $\bmA$, and
the symmetric $n$ by $n$ Hessian matrix $\bmH$ (when available) may
be stored in a variety of input formats.

\subsubsection{Dense storage format}\label{dense}
The matrices $\bmA$ and $\bmJ$ are stored as compact dense matrices by
rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
Component $n \ast (i-1) + j$ of the storage array {\tt A\%val} will
hold the value $\bmA_{ij}$ for $i = 1, \ldots , m_a$, $j = 1, \ldots ,
n$.  Similarly, component $n \ast (i-1) + j$ of the storage array {\tt
  J\%val} will hold the value $\bmJ_{i,j}$ for $i = 1, \ldots , m$, $j =
1, \ldots , n$.  Since $\bmH$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular
part (that is the part $\bmH_{ij}$ for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$)
should be stored. In this case the lower triangle will be stored by rows, that is
component $i \ast (i-1)/2 + j$ of the storage array {\tt H\%val} will
hold the value $\bmH_{ij}$ (and, by symmetry, $\bmH_{ji}$) for $1 \leq j
\leq i \leq n$.

\subsubsection{Sparse co-ordinate storage format}\label{coordinate}
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored. For the $l$-th
entry of $\bmA$, its row index $i$, column index $j$ and value
$\bmA_{ij}$ are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer arrays
{\tt A\%row}, {\tt A\%col} and real array {\tt A\%val}.  Similarly,
the $l$-th entry of $\bmJ$, its row index $i$, column index $j$ and
value $\bmJ_{ij}$ are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer
arrays {\tt J\%row}, {\tt J\%col} and real array {\tt J\%val}.  The
order is unimportant, but the total number of entries {\tt A\%ne} and
{\tt J\%ne} are required.  The same scheme is applicable to $\bmH$
(thus requiring integer arrays {\tt H\%row}, {\tt H\%col}, a real
array {\tt H\%val}, and an integer value {\tt H\%ne}), except that only
the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

We recommend this storage format since it is the most efficient
storage scheme for the underlying linear system solvers.  Any other
storage formats are converted internally to sparse co-ordinate
storage and then handled accordingly.

\subsubsection{Sparse row-wise storage format}\label{rowwise}
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are
ordered so that those in row $i$ appear directly before those in row
$i+1$. For the $i$-th row of $\bmA$, the $i$-th component of the integer
array {\tt A\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while {\tt A\%ptr} $(m_a+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices $j$ and values $\bmA_{ij}$ of the entries in the
$i$-th row are stored in components $l =$ {\tt A\%ptr}$(i)$, \ldots
,{\tt A\%ptr} $(i+1)-1$ of the integer array {\tt A\%col}, and real
array {\tt A\%val}, respectively.  Similarly, for the $i$-th row of
$\bmJ$, the $i$-th component of the integer array {\tt J\%ptr} holds the
position of the first entry in this row, while {\tt J\%ptr} $(m+1)$
holds the total number of entries plus one.  The column indices $j$
and values $\bmJ_{ij}$ of the entries in the $i$-th row are stored in
components $l =$ {\tt J\%ptr}$(i)$, \ldots ,{\tt J\%ptr} $(i+1)-1$ of
the integer array {\tt J\%col}, and real array {\tt J\%val},
respectively.  The same scheme is applicable to
$\bmH$ (thus requiring integer arrays {\tt H\%ptr}, {\tt H\%col}, and 
a real array {\tt H\%val}),
except that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than 
its predecessor.

\subsubsection{Sparse column-wise storage format}\label{columnwise}
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are
ordered so that those in column $j$ appear directly before those in
column $j+1$. For the $j$-th column of $\bmA$, the $j$-th component of
the integer array {\tt A\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in
this column, while {\tt A\%ptr} $(n+1)$ holds the total number of
entries plus one.  The row indices $i$ and values $\bmA_{ij}$ of the
entries in the $j$-th column are stored in components $l =$ {\tt
  A\%ptr}$(j)$, \ldots ,{\tt A\%ptr} $(j+1)-1$ of the integer array
{\tt A\%row}, and real array {\tt A\%val}, respectively.  Similarly,
for the $j$-th column of $\bmJ$, the $j$-th component of the integer array
{\tt J\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this column,
while {\tt J\%ptr} $(n+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The row indices $i$ and values $\bmJ_{ij}$ of the entries in the
$j$-th column are stored in components $l =$ {\tt J\%ptr}$(j)$, \ldots
,{\tt J\%ptr} $(j+1)-1$ of the integer array {\tt J\%row}, and real
array {\tt J\%val}, respectively.  The same scheme is applicable to
$\bmH$ (thus requiring integer arrays {\tt H\%ptr}, {\tt H\%row}, and
a real array {\tt H\%val}), except that only the entries in the lower
triangle should be stored.

\subsubsection{Diagonal storage format}\label{diagonal}
If $\bmH$ is diagonal (i.e., $\bmH_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \neq j \leq n$)
only the diagonal entries $\bmH_{ii}$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$ need be stored,
and the first $n$ components of the array {\tt H\%val} may be used for 
the purpose. There is no sensible equivalent for the non-square
matrices $\bmA$ and $\bmJ$.

\begin{description}

\ittf{m} is a scalar component of type \integer, 
that holds the number of rows of the matrix.

\ittf{n} is a scalar component of type \integer, 
that holds the number of columns of the matrix. 
 
\ittf{ne} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that
holds the number of matrix entries.

\ittf{type} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \character, that
is used to indicate the matrix storage scheme used. Its precise length and

$\bmH_{ij} = \bmH_{ji}$ is represented
as a single entry (see \S\ref{dense}--\ref{columnwise}).

and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the row indices of the entries 
(see \S\ref{coordinate} and \S\ref{columnwise}).

\ittf{col} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer\ 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the column indices of the entries
(see \S\ref{coordinate}--\ref{rowwise}).

allocatable array of type \integer\ and dimension at least
{\tt m + 1}, that may hold the pointers to the first entry in each row
(see \S\ref{rowwise}).  For sparse column-wise storage, {\tt ptr}
is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer\ and
dimension at least {\tt n + 1}, that may hold the pointers to the
first entry in each column (see \S\ref{columnwise}).

%%%%%%%%%%% control type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding control 
 parameters}\label{typecontrol}
The derived data type 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type} 
is used to hold controlling data. Default values may be obtained by calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
(see Section~\ref{subinit}). The components of 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type} 
are:

\begin{description}

\itt{print\_level} is a scalar variable of type \integer\ that is used
to control the amount of informational output which is required. No 
informational output will occur if {\tt print\_level} $\leq$ 0. 
If {\tt print\_level} $= 1$, a single line of output will be produced for each
iteration of the process. If {\tt print\_level} $\geq 2$, this output will be
increased to provide significant detail of each iteration.
The default is {\tt print\_level} $= 0$. 

\itt{out} is a scalar variable of type \integer\ that holds the
stream number for informational messages.
Printing of informational messages in 
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
is suppressed if {\tt out} $\leq 0$.
The default is {\tt out} $= 6$.

\itt{error} is a scalar variable of type \integer\ that holds the
stream number for error messages.
Printing of error messages in 
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
and
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}
is suppressed if {\tt error} $\leq$ 0.
The default is {\tt error} $=$ 6.

\itt{print\_number} is a scalar variable of type \integer\
that holds {\em half} the number of vector components that will be
printed for each print statement.  To be precise, the first {\tt
  print\_number} and the last {\tt print\_number} components of each
vector will be printed.  If $2\ast${\tt print\_number} is greater than the
length of the vector to be printed, then the entire vector is printed.

\itt{alive\_unit} is a scalar variable of type \integer.
If {\tt alive\_unit} $>$ 0, a temporary file named {\tt alive\_file} (see below)
will be created on stream number {\tt alive\_unit} on initial entry to 
{\tt \packagename\_solve}, and execution of {\tt \packagename\_solve} will continue so
long as this file continues to exist. Thus, a user may terminate execution
simply by removing the temporary file from this unit.
If {\tt alive\_unit} $\leq$ 0, no temporary file will be created and
execution cannot be terminated in this way.
The default is {\tt alive\_unit} $=$ 60.

%%%%%%%%%%% data type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding problem data}\label{typedata}
The derived data type 
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
is used to hold all the data for a particular problem,
or sequences of problems with the same structure, between calls of 
{\tt \packagename} procedures. 
This data should be preserved, untouched (except as directed on
return from {\tt \packagename\_solve} with positive values of
{\tt inform\%status}, see Section~\ref{reverse}),
from the initial call to 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
to the final call to
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% argument lists %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galarguments
There are three procedures for user calls:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The subroutine 
      {\tt \packagename\_initialize} 
      is used to set default values, and initialize private data, 
      before solving \ldots
\item The subroutine 
      {\tt \packagename\_solve} 
      is called to solve \ldots
\item The subroutine 
      {\tt \packagename\_terminate} 
      is provided to allow the user to automatically deallocate array 
       components of the private data, allocated by 
       {\tt \packagename\_solve}, 
       at the end of the solution process. 
\end{enumerate}
We use square brackets {\tt [ ]} to indicate \optional\ arguments.

%%%%%% initialization subroutine %%%%%%

solved.

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}

These values should only be changed after calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.

prior to the first call to 
{\tt \packagename\_solve}.

\itt{inform} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typeinform}). A successful call to
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
is indicated when the  component {\tt status} has the value 0. 
For other return values of {\tt status}, see Section~\ref{galerrors}.

\itt{data} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
