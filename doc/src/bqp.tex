%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary
This package uses a preconditioned, projected-gradient method
to solve the {\bf convex bound-constrained quadratic programming problem}
\disp{\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(\bmx) = \half \bmx^T \bmH \bmx + \bmg^T \bmx + f}
subject to the simple bound constraints
\disp{x_{j}^{l}  \leq  x_{j}^{ } \leq  x_{j}^{u} , \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,}
where the $n$ by $n$ symmetric, positive-definite matrix $\bmH$, the 
vectors $\bmg$, $\bmx^{l}$, $\bmx^{u}$ and the scalar $f$ are given.
Any of the constraint bounds $x_{j}^{l}$ and $x_{j}^{u}$ may be infinite.
Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix $\bmH$;
the matrix need not be provided as there are options to obtain matrix-vector
products involving $\bmH$ either by reverse communication or from a 
user-provided subroutine.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% matrix formats %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmatrix
When it is explicitly available,  
the Hessian matrix $\bmH$ may be stored in a variety of input formats.

\subsubsection{Dense storage format}\label{dense}
Since $\bmH$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part 
$h_{ij}$ for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$) need be held. 
The lower-triangular part of $\bmH$ is stored as a compact 
dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries that occur before
or on the diagonal of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
That is component $i \ast (i-1)/2 + j$ of the storage array {\tt H\%val}  
will hold the value $h_{ij}$ (and, by symmetry, $h_{ji}$)
for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$.

\subsubsection{Sparse co-ordinate storage format}\label{coordinate}
Only the nonzero entries of the lower triangular part of $\bmH$ is stored. 
For the $l$-th entry of the lower triangular part of $\bmH$, 
its row index $i$, column index $j$ and value $h_{ij}$
are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer arrays {\tt H\%row}, 
{\tt H\%col} and real array {\tt H\%val}, respectively.
The order is unimportant, but the total
number of entries {\tt H\%ne} is also required. 

\subsubsection{Sparse row-wise storage format}\label{rowwise}
Again only the nonzero nonzero entries of the lower triangular 
part of $\bmH$ is stored, but this time they are ordered so that those 
that occur before or on the diagonal in row $i$ appear directly before those
in row $i+1$. For the $i$-th row of $\bmH$, the $i$-th component of a 
integer array {\tt H\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while {\tt H\%ptr} $(n+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices $j$ and values $h_{ij}$ of the entries 
occurring before or on the diagonal in the $i$-th row are stored in components 
$l =$ {\tt H\%ptr}$(i)$, \ldots ,{\tt H\%ptr} $(i+1)-1$ of the 
integer array {\tt H\%col}, and real array {\tt H\%val}, respectively. 

For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than 
its predecessor.

\subsubsection{Diagonal storage format}\label{diagonal}
If $\bmH$ is diagonal (i.e., $h_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \neq j \leq n$)
only the diagonals entries $h_{ii}$, $1 \leq i \leq n$,  need be stored,
and the first $n$ components of the array {\tt H\%val} may be used for 
the purpose. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% derived types %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galtypes
Ten derived data types are accessible from the package.

%%%%%%%%%%% matrix data type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding matrices}\label{typesmt}
The derived data type {\tt SMT\_TYPE} is used to hold the matrix $\bmH$. 
The components of {\tt SMT\_TYPE} used here are:

\begin{description}

\ittf{n} is a scalar component of type default \integer, 
that holds the number of columns in the matrix. 
 
\ittf{ne} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that
holds the number of matrix entries.

\ittf{type} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \character, that
is used to indicate the matrix storage scheme used. Its precise length and
content depends on the type of matrix to be stored (see \S\ref{typeprob}).

\ittf{val} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \realdp\, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that holds the values of the entries. 
Each pair of off-diagonal entries $h_{ij} = h_{ji}$ of a {\em symmetric}
matrix $\bmH$ is represented as a single entry 
(see \S\ref{dense}--\ref{rowwise}).
Any duplicated entries that appear in the sparse 
co-ordinate or row-wise schemes will be summed. 

\ittf{row} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the row indices of the entries. 
(see \S\ref{coordinate}).

\ittf{col} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may the column indices of the entries
(see \S\ref{coordinate}--\ref{rowwise}).

\ittf{ptr} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt m + 1}, that may hold the pointers to
the first entry in each row (see \S\ref{rowwise}).

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%% problem type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding the problem}\label{typeprob}
The derived data type {\tt QPT\_problem\_type} is used to hold 
the problem. The components of 
{\tt QPT\_problem\_type} 
are:

\begin{description}

\ittf{n} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, 
 that holds the number of optimization variables, $n$.  
              
\ittf{H} is scalar variable of type {\tt SMT\_TYPE} 
that holds the Hessian matrix $\bmH$. The following components
are used:

\begin{description}

\itt{H\%type} is an allocatable array of rank one and type default \character, that
is used to indicate the storage scheme used. If the dense storage scheme 
(see Section~\ref{dense}) is used, 
the first five components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt DENSE}.
For the sparse co-ordinate scheme (see Section~\ref{coordinate}), 
the first ten components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt COORDINATE},  
for the sparse row-wise storage scheme (see Section~\ref{rowwise}),
the first fourteen components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS},
and for the diagonal storage scheme (see Section~\ref{diagonal}),
the first eight components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt DIAGONAL}.

For convenience, the procedure {\tt SMT\_put} 
may be used to allocate sufficient space and insert the required keyword
into {\tt H\%type}.
For example, if {\tt prob} is of derived type {\tt \packagename\_problem\_type}
and involves a Hessian we wish to store using the co-ordinate scheme,
we may simply
%\vspace*{-2mm}
{\tt 
\begin{verbatim}
        CALL SMT_put( prob%H%type, 'COORDINATE', istat )
\end{verbatim}
}
%\vspace*{-4mm}
\noindent
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SMT} 
for further details on the use of {\tt SMT\_put}.

\itt{H\%ne} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that 
holds the number of entries in the {\bf lower triangular} part of $\bmH$
in the sparse co-ordinate storage scheme (see Section~\ref{coordinate}). 
It need not be set for any of the other three schemes.

\itt{H\%col} is a rank-one allocatable array variable of type default \integer,
that holds the column indices of the {\bf lower triangular} part of 
$\bmH$ in either the sparse co-ordinate

(see Section~\ref{rowwise}) storage scheme.
It need not be allocated when the dense or diagonal storage schemes are used.

\itt{H\%ptr} is a rank-one allocatable array of dimension {\tt n+1} and type 
default \integer, that holds the starting position of 
each row of the {\bf lower triangular} part of $\bmH$, as well
as the total number of entries plus one, in the sparse row-wise storage
scheme (see Section~\ref{rowwise}). It need not be allocated when the
other schemes are used.

where {\tt infinity} is a component of the control array {\tt control} 
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}).

\ittf{X\_u} is a rank-one allocatable array of dimension {\tt n} and type 
default \realdp, that holds
the vector of upper bounds $\bmx^{u}$ on the variables.
The $j$-th component of {\tt X\_u}, $j = 1, \ldots , n$, 
contains $\bmx_{j}^{u}$.

components of {\tt X\_u} to any value larger than that {\tt infinity}, 
where {\tt infinity} is a component of the control array {\tt control} 
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}).

(see Section~\ref{galmethod}).
The default is {\tt stop\_c =} $u^{1/3}$,

{\tt \fullpackagename\_double}).

\itt{identical\_bounds\_tol}
is a scalar variable of type default \realdp.
Each pair of variable bounds $(x_{j}^{l}, x_{j}^{u})$
that is closer than {\tt identical\_bounds\_tol} 
will be reset to the average of their values,
$\half (x_{j}^{l} + x_{j}^{u})$.
The default is {\tt identical\_bounds\_tol =} $u$,
where $u$ is {\tt EPSILON(1.0)} ({\tt EPSILON(1.0D0)} in 
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double}).

\itt{stop\_cg\_relative} and {\tt stop\_cg\_absolute} 
are scalar variables of type default \realdp, 
that hold the relative and absolute convergence tolerances for the
conjugate-gradient iteration that occurs in the face of currently-active
constraints when constructing the search direction.
{\tt \_stop\_cg\_relative = 0.01}
and \sloppy {\tt stop\_cg\_absolute =} $\sqrt{u}$,

{\tt \fullpackagename\_double}).

\itt{cpu\_time\_limit} is a scalar variable of type default \realdp, 
that is used to specify the maximum permitted CPU time. Any negative
value indicates no limit will be imposed. The default is 
{\tt cpu\_time\_limit = - 1.0}.

\itt{exact\_gcp} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that should
be set \true\ if the exact generalized Cauchy point,
the first estimate of the minimizer of the objective in the
Cauchy direction within
the feasible box, is required, and \false\ if an approximation suffices.
The default is {\tt exact\_gcp = \true}.

\itt{space\_critical} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, 
that must be set \true\ if space is critical when allocating arrays
and  \false\ otherwise. The package may run faster if 
{\tt space\_critical} is \false\ but at the possible expense of a larger
storage requirement. The default is {\tt space\_critical = .FALSE.}.

\itt{deallocate\_error\_fatal} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, 
that must be set \true\ if the user wishes to terminate execution if
a deallocation  fails, and \false\ if an attempt to continue
will be made. The default is {\tt deallocate\_error\_fatal = .FALSE.}.

\itt{prefix} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 30, that may be used to provide a user-selected 
character string to preface every line of printed output. 
Specifically, each line of output will be prefaced by the string 
{\tt prefix(2:LEN(TRIM(prefix))-1)},
thus ignoring the first and last non-null components of the
supplied string. If the user does not want to preface lines by such
a string, they may use the default {\tt prefix = ""}.

\itt{SBLS\_control} is a scalar variable of type 
{\tt SBLS\_control\_type} %(see Section~\ref{typeebqpontrol}
whose components are used to control the factorization and/or
preconditioner used,

described in Section~\ref{typecontrol}.
These values should only be changed after calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.

%%%%%%%%% main solution subroutine %%%%%%

\subsubsection{The quadratic programming subroutine}\label{qps}
The quadratic programming solution algorithm is called as follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_solve( prob, B\_stat, data, control, inform, userdata[,
reverse, eval\_HPROD] )}           
%\&}
%\vspace*{-1mm}

%\hspace{37mm}
%{\tt  
%eval\_HPROD] )}

\vspace*{-3mm}
\begin{description}
\ittf{prob} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type 
{\tt QPT\_problem\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typeprob}). 
It is used to hold data about the problem being solved.
The user must allocate all the array components,
and set values for all components, except perhaps {\tt prob\%H};
if the effect of $\bmH$ is only available to form products 
via reverse communication (see {\tt reverse} below)
or with a user-supplied subroutine (see {\tt eval\_HPROD} below)
{\tt prob\%H} and it is not needed, but otherwise {\tt prob\%H} should be
set using whichever
of the matrix formats described in Section~\ref{galmatrix} 
is appropriate for $\bmH$ for the user's application.

The components {\tt prob\%X} and {\tt prob\%Z}
must be set to initial estimates of the primal variables, 
$\bmx$ and dual variables for the bound constraints, $\bmz$, respectively.
Inappropriate initial values will be altered, so the user should
not be overly concerned if suitable values are not apparent, and may be
content with merely setting {\tt prob\%X=0.0}
and {\tt prob\%Z=0.0}.
%The component {\tt prob\%C} need not be set on entry.

On exit, the components {\tt prob\%X} and {\tt prob\%Z}
will contain the best estimates of the primal variables $\bmx$, 
and dual variables for the bound constraints $\bmz$, respectively.
\restrictions {\tt prob\%n} $> 0$
              and (if $\bmH$ is provided) {\tt prob\%H\%ne} $\geq -2$.
{\tt prob\%H\_type} $\in \{${\tt 'DENSE'}, 
 {\tt 'COORDINATE'}, {\tt 'SPARSE\_BY\_\-ROWS'}, {\tt 'DIAGONAL'} $\}$. 

\itt{B\_stat} is a rank-one \intentinout\ array argument of dimension {\tt prob\%n}
and type default \integer, that indicates which of the simple bound 
constraints are in the current working set. Possible values for 
{\tt B\_stat(j)}, {\tt j}$=1, \ldots ,$ {\tt prob\%n}, and their meanings are
\begin{description}
\itt{<0} the $j$-th simple bound constraint 
is in the working set, on its lower bound,
\itt{>0} the $j$-th simple bound constraint 
is in the working set, on its upper bound, and
\itt{0}  the $j$-th simple bound constraint is not in the working set.
\end{description}
Suitable values must be supplied if 
{\tt control\%bqp\_control\%cold\_start = 0} on entry,
but need not be provided for other input values of {\tt control\%cold\_start}.
Inappropriate values will be ignored.
On exit, {\tt B\_stat} will contain values appropriate for the ultimate
working set.

\itt{data} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typedata}). It is used to hold data about the problem being 
solved. It must not have been altered {\bf by the user} since the last call to 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}). Default values may be assigned by calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize} prior to the first call to 
{\tt \packagename\_solve}.

\itt{inform} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typeinform}). On initial entry, the component {\tt status}
must be set to {\tt 1}, while other components need not be set.
A successful call to
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
is indicated when the  component {\tt status} has the value 0. 
For other return values of {\tt status}, see Sections~\ref{reverse} and 
\ref{galerrors}.

\itt{userdata} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type 
{\tt NLPT\_userdata\_type} whose components may be used
to communicate user-supplied data 
(see Section~\ref{typeuserdata})
to and from the \optional\ subroutine
 {\tt eval\_HPROD} (see below).

\itt{reverse} is an \optional\ scalar \intentinout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_reverse\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typereverse}). 
It is used to communicate reverse-communication data between the 
subroutine and calling program.
If {\tt reverse} is \present\ and {\tt eval\%HPROD} (see below) is
absent, the user should monitor {\tt inform\%status} on exit
(see Section~\ref{reverse}).

\itt{eval\_HPROD} is an \optional\ 
user-supplied subroutine whose purpose is to evaluate the value of the 
product $\bmH \bmv$ of the Hessian of the objective function 
with a given vector $\bmv$.
See Section~\ref{prodfv} for details.
If {\tt eval\_HPROD} is present, 
it must be declared {\tt EXTERNAL} in the calling program.
If {\tt eval\_HPROD} is absent, \solver\ will use reverse communication 
(see Section~\ref{reverse}) 
to obtain Hessian-vector products if {\tt reverse} is \present\ or
otherwise require that the user has provided all relevant
components of {\tt prob\%H}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%% termination subroutine %%%%%%

\subsubsection{The  termination subroutine}
All previously allocated arrays are deallocated as follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_terminate( data, control, inform )}

\vspace*{-3mm}
\begin{description}

\itt{data} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type} 
exactly as for
{\tt \packagename\_solve},
which must not have been altered {\bf by the user} since the last call to 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, array components will have been deallocated.

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
exactly as for
{\tt \packagename\_solve}.

\itt{inform} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
exactly as for
{\tt \packagename\_solve}.
Only the component {\tt status} will be set on exit, and a 
successful call to 
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}
is indicated when this  component {\tt status} has the value 0. 
For other return values of {\tt status}, see Section~\ref{galerrors}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Hessian-vector products %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Hessian-vector products via internal evaluation\label{prodfv}}

If the argument {\tt eval\_HPROD} is present when calling \solver, the
user is expected to provide a subroutine of that name to evaluate the
product of the Hessian of the objective function $\bmH$
with a given vector $\bmv$.
The routine must be specified as

\def\baselinestretch{0.8}
{\tt \begin{verbatim}
       SUBROUTINE eval_HPROD( status, userdata, V, PROD[, NZ_v, nz_v_start,  nz_v_end,     &
                              NZ_prod, nz_prod_end] )
\end{verbatim} }
\def\baselinestretch{1.0}
\noindent whose arguments are as follows:

\begin{description}
\itt{status} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type default \integer,
that should be set to 0 if the routine has been able to evaluate the
product $\bmH \bmv$ 
and to a non-zero value if the evaluation has not been possible.

\itt{userdata} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type 
{\tt NLPT\_userdata\_type} whose components may be used
to communicate user-supplied data to and from the
subroutine (see Section~\ref{typeuserdata}). 

\ittf{V} is a rank-one \intentin\ array argument of type default \realdp\
whose components contain the vector $\bmv$. 
If components
{\tt nz\_v\_start},
{\tt nz\_v\_end} 
and
{\tt NZ\_v} 
(see below) are \present,
only components {\tt NZ\_v(nz\_v\_start:nz\_v\_end)} of {\tt V} 
will be nonzero and the remaining components of {\tt V} should be
ignored. Otherwise, all components of {\tt V} should be presumed to be nonzero.

\ittf{PROD} is a rank-one \intentout\ array argument of type default \realdp\
whose components on output contain the required components of $\bmH \bmv$.
If components
{\tt nz\_prod\_end} 
and
{\tt NZ\_prod} 
(see below) are \present, 
only the nonzero components {\tt NZ\_prod(1:nz\_prod\_end)} of {\tt PROD} 
need be assigned.
Otherwise, all components of {\tt PROD} must be set.

\itt{nz\_v\_start} is an \optional\ scalar variable of type default \integer, 
that, if \present, holds the starting position in {\tt NZ\_v}
of the list of indices of nonzero components of $\bmv$.

\itt{nz\_v\_end} is an \optional\ scalar variable of type default \integer, 
that, if \present, holds the finishing position in {\tt NZ\_v}
of the list of indices of nonzero components of $\bmv$.

\itt{NZ\_v} is an \optional\  rank-one allocatable array of dimension $n$
and type default \integer that, if \present, holds the indices of the
nonzero components of $\bmv$. If any of 
{\tt nz\_v\_start},
{\tt nz\_v\_end} 
and
{\tt NZ\_v} 
are absent, all components of {\tt V} are assumed to be nonzero.

\itt{nz\_prod\_end} is an \optional\ scalar variable of type default \integer
that, if \present, must be set to record the number of non-zeros in 
$\bmH \bmv$.

\itt{NZ\_prod} is an \optional\ rank-one allocatable array of dimension $n$
and type default \integer that, if \present must be set to record the list of
indices of nonzero components of $\bmH \bmv$. 
If either of 
{\tt nz\_prod\_end} 
and
{\tt NZ\_prod} 
are absent, all components of {\tt PROD} should be set even if they are zero.


\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Reverse communication %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\label{reverse}Reverse Communication Information}

A positive value of {\tt inform\%status} on exit from 
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
indicates that
\solver\ is seeking further information---this will happen 
if the user has chosen to evaluate matrix-vector products by
reverse communication.
The user should compute the required information and re-enter \solver\
with {\tt inform\%status} and all other arguments (except those specifically
mentioned below) unchanged.

Possible values of {\tt inform\%status} and the information required are
\begin{description}
\ittf{2.} The user should compute the matrix-vector product $\bmH \bmv$ 
     using the vector $\bmv$ whose components are stored in {\tt reverse\%V}
     and store the required product in {\tt reverse\%PROD}.

\ittf{3.} The user should compute the matrix-vector product $\bmH \bmv$ 
     using the vector $\bmv$ whose nonzero components are stored in 
     positions  
     {\tt reverse\%NZ\_v(reverse\%nz\_v\_start:reverse\%nz\_v\_end)} 
     of {\tt reverse\%V}. The remaining components of {\tt reverse\%V}
     should be ignored.

\ittf{4.} The user should compute the nonzero components of the 
     matrix-vector product $\bmH \bmv$ 
     using the vector $\bmv$ whose nonzero components are stored in 
     positions  
     {\tt reverse\%NZ\_v(reverse\%nz\_v\_start:reverse\%nz\_v\_end)} 
     of \linebreak {\tt reverse\%V}. The remaining components of 
     {\tt reverse\%V}
     should be ignored. The nonzero components must occupy positions
     {\tt reverse\%NZ\_prod(1:reverse\%nz\_prod\_end)} of {\tt reverse\%PROD},
     and the components \linebreak
     {\tt reverse\%NZ\_prod} and {\tt reverse\%nz\_prod\_end} must be set.
     This return can only happen if {\tt control\%exact\_gcp} is \true.

\end{description}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Warning and error messages %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galerrors
A negative value of {\tt inform\%status} on exit from 
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
or 
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}
indicates that an error has occurred. No further calls should be made
until the error has been corrected. Possible values are:

\begin{description}

\itt{\galerrallocate.} An allocation error occurred. A message indicating 
the offending 
array is written on unit {\tt control\%error}, and the returned allocation 
status and a string containing the name of the offending array
are held in {\tt inform\%alloc\_\-status}
and {\tt inform\%bad\_alloc} respectively.

\itt{\galerrdeallocate.} A deallocation error occurred. 
A message indicating the offending 
array is written on unit {\tt control\%error} and the returned allocation 
status and a string containing the name of the offending array
are held in {\tt inform\%alloc\_\-status}
and {\tt inform\%bad\_alloc} respectively.

\itt{\galerrrestrictions.} One of the restrictions 
 {\tt prob\%n} $> 0$ 
    or the requirement that 
    {\tt prob\%H\_type} contain its relevant string
    {\tt 'DENSE'}, {\tt 'COORDINATE'}, {\tt 'SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS'}
    or {\tt 'DIAGONAL'} when $\bmH$ is available,
    has been violated.

%\itt{-3.} At least one of the arrays 
% {\tt prob\%A\_val}, {\tt prob\%A\_row}, {\tt prob\%A\_col},
% {\tt prob\%H\_val}, {\tt prob\%H\_row} or {\tt prob\%H\_col},
% is not large enough to hold the original, or reordered, matrix $\bmH$.

\itt{\galerrbadbounds.} The bound constraints are inconsistent.

\itt{\galerranalysis.} The analysis phase of the factorization failed; 
  the return status from the factorization
    package is given in the component {\tt inform\%fac\-t\-or\_status}.

\itt{\galerrfactorization.} The factorization failed; the return status 
  from the factorization
    package is given in the component {\tt inform\%fac\-t\-or\_status}.

\itt{\galerrillconditioned.} The problem is so ill-conditioned that 
 further progress is impossible.

\itt{\galerrtinystep.} The step is too small to make further impact.

\itt{\galerrmaxiterations.} Too many iterations have been performed. 
   This may happen if
    {\tt control\%maxit} is too small, but may also be symptomatic of 
    a badly scaled problem.

\itt{\galerrcpulimit.} The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen if
    {\tt control\%cpu\_time\_limit} is too small, but may also be symptomatic 
    of a badly scaled problem.

\itt{\galerrinertia.} The Hessian matrix $\bmH$ of the objective function 
  appears to be indefinite.

\itt{\galerrupperentry.} An entry from the strict upper triangle of $\bmH$ 
 has been specified.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Further features %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galfeatures
\noindent In this section, we describe an alternative means of setting 
control parameters, that is components of the variable {\tt control} of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}), 
by reading an appropriate data specification file using the
subroutine {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}. This facility
is useful as it allows a user to change  {\tt \packagename} control parameters 
without editing and recompiling programs that call {\tt \packagename}.

A specification file, or specfile, is a data file containing a number of 
"specification commands". Each command occurs on a separate line, 
and comprises a "keyword", 
which is a string (in a close-to-natural language) used to identify a 
control parameter, and 
an (optional) "value", which defines the value to be assigned to the given
control parameter. All keywords and values are case insensitive, 
keywords may be preceded by one or more blanks but
values must not contain blanks, and
each value must be separated from its keyword by at least one blank.
Values must not contain more than 30 characters, and 
each line of the specfile is limited to 80 characters,
including the blanks separating keyword and value.



The portion of the specification file used by 
{\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
must start
with a "{\tt BEGIN \packagename}" command and end with an 
"{\tt END}" command.  The syntax of the specfile is thus defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  ( .. lines ignored by BQP_read_specfile .. )
    BEGIN BQP
       keyword    value
       .......    .....
       keyword    value
    END 
  ( .. lines ignored by BQP_read_specfile .. )
\end{verbatim}
where keyword and value are two strings separated by (at least) one blank.
The ``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiter command lines 
may contain additional (trailing) strings so long as such strings are 
separated by one or more blanks, so that lines such as
\begin{verbatim}
    BEGIN BQP SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
    END BQP SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
are acceptable. Furthermore, 
between the
``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiters,
specification commands may occur in any order.  Blank lines and
lines whose first non-blank character is {\tt !} or {\tt *} are ignored. 
The content 
of a line after a {\tt !} or {\tt *} character is also 
ignored (as is the {\tt !} or {\tt *}
character itself). This provides an easy manner to "comment out" some 
specification commands, or to comment specific values 
of certain control parameters.  

The value of a control parameters may be of three different types, namely
integer, logical or real.
Integer and real values may be expressed in any relevant Fortran integer and
floating-point formats (respectively). Permitted values for logical
parameters are "{\tt ON}", "{\tt TRUE}", "{\tt .TRUE.}", "{\tt T}", 
"{\tt YES}", "{\tt Y}", or "{\tt OFF}", "{\tt NO}",
"{\tt N}", "{\tt FALSE}", "{\tt .FALSE.}" and "{\tt F}". 
Empty values are also allowed for 
logical control parameters, and are interpreted as "{\tt TRUE}".  

The specification file must be open for 
input when {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
is called, and the associated device number 
passed to the routine in device (see below). 
Note that the corresponding 
file is {\tt REWIND}ed, which makes it possible to combine the specifications 
for more than one program/routine.  For the same reason, the file is not
closed by {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}.

\subsubsection{To read control parameters from a specification file}
\label{readspec}

Control parameters may be read from a file as follows:
\hskip0.5in 

\def\baselinestretch{0.8}
{\tt 
\begin{verbatim}
     CALL BQP_read_specfile( control, device )

\def\baselinestretch{1.0}

\begin{description}
\itt{control} is a scalar \intentinout argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}). 
Default values should have already been set, perhaps by calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, individual components of {\tt control} may have been changed
according to the commands found in the specfile. Specfile commands and 
the component (see Section~\ref{typecontrol}) of {\tt control} 
that each affects are given in Table~\ref{specfile}.

\itt{device} is a scalar \intentin argument of type default \integer,
that must be set to the unit number on which the specfile
has been opened. If {\tt device} is not open, {\tt control} will
not be altered and execution will continue, but an error message
will be printed on unit {\tt control\%error}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Information printed %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galinfo
If {\tt control\%print\_level} is positive, information about the progress 
of the algorithm will be printed on unit {\tt control\-\%out}.
If {\tt control\%print\_level} $= 1$, a single line of output will be produced 
for each iteration of the process. 
For the initial-feasible-point phase,
this will include values of the current primal and dual infeasibility, and
violation of complementary slackness, the feasibility-phase objective value,
the current steplength, the value of the barrier parameter, the
number of backtracks in the linesearch and the elapsed CPU time in seconds.
Once a suitable feasible point has been found, the iteration is divided
into major iterations, at which the barrier parameter is reduced, and
minor iterations, and which the barrier function is approximately minimized
for the current value of the barrier parameter. For the major iterations,
the value of the barrier parameter, the required values of 
dual feasibility and violation of complementary slackness, and the current
constraint infeasibility are reported. Each minor iteration of the
optimality phase results in a line giving 
the current dual feasibility and violation of complementary slackness, the
objective function value, the ratio of predicted to achieved reduction 
of the objective function, the trust-region radius, the 
number of backtracks in the linesearch, the number of conjugate-gradient 
iterations taken, and the elapsed CPU time in seconds. 

If {\tt control\%print\_level} $\geq 2$ this 
output will be increased to provide significant detail of each iteration. 
This extra output includes residuals of the linear systems solved, and,
for larger values of {\tt control\%print\_level}, values of the primal and dual
variables and Lagrange multipliers.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% METHOD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmethod
The required solution $\bmx$ necessarily satisfies 
the primal optimality conditions
\eqn{4.1}{
\bmx^{l} \leq\bmx \leq\bmx^{u},}
the dual optimality conditions
\eqn{4.2a}{
 \bmH \bmx + \bmg = \bmz
 \tim{and}
 \bmz = \bmz^{l} + \bmz^{u} ,}
and 
\eqn{4.2b}{
 \bmz^{l} \geq 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\;
 \bmz^{u} \leq 0 ,}
and the complementary slackness conditions 
\eqn{4.3}{
(\bmx -\bmx^{l} )^{T} \bmz^{l} = 0   \tim{and}
(\bmx -\bmx^{u} )^{T} \bmz^{u} = 0 ,}
where the components of the vector $\bmz$ are known as 
the dual variables for the bounds,
and where the vector inequalities hold componentwise.
Projected-gradient methods iterate towards a point
that satisfies these conditions by ultimately aiming to satisfy
\req{4.2a}, while ensuring that 
\req{4.1}, and \req{4.2b} and \req{4.3} are satisfied at each stage. 
Appropriate norms of the amounts by 
which \req{4.1}, \req{4.2a} and \req{4.3} fail to be satisfied are known as the
primal and dual infeasibility, and the violation of complementary slackness,
respectively. 

The method is iterative. Each iteration proceeds in two stages.
Firstly, the so-called generalized Cauchy point for the quadratic
objective is found.  (The purpose of this point is to ensure that the
algorithm converges and that the set of bounds which are satisfied as
equations at the solution is rapidly identified.)  Thereafter an
improvement to the objective is sought using either a
direct-matrix or truncated conjugate-gradient algorithm.

respectively.

If instead $\bmH$ had been the diagonal matrix
\disp{\bmH = \mat{ccc}{1 & &   \\ & 2 & \\  &  & 3}}
but the other data is as before, the diagonal storage scheme 
might be used for $\bmH$, and in this case we would instead 
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
   CALL SMT_put( prob%H%type, 'DIAGONAL', s )  ! Specify dense storage for H
   ALLOCATE( p%H%val( n ) )
   p%H%val = (/ 1.0_wp, 2.0_wp, 3.0_wp /) ! Hessian values
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
%Notice here that zero diagonal entries are stored.

The same problem may be solved using reverse communication with the
following code:

{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageexampleb}
}
\noindent
Notice that storage for the Hessian is now not needed.
This produces the same output.
%This produces the following output:
%{\tt \small
%\VerbatimInput{\packageresultsb}
%}
%\noindent

The same problem may also be solved by user-provided matrix-vector
products as follows:

{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageexamplec}
}
\noindent
Now notice how the matrix $\bmH$ is passed to the matrix-vector product 
evaluation routine via the {\tt integer} and 
{\tt real} components of the derived type {\tt userdata}.

%This produces the following output:
%%{\tt \small
