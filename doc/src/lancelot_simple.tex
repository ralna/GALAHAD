%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary

{\tt \packagename} is a Fortran module for minimizing an objective function,
where the minimization variables are required to satisfy a set of auxiliary,
possibly nonlinear, constraints.  Bounds on the variables and known values may
be specified.  The module povides access to a single subroutine, called {\tt
LANCELOT\_simple}, which in turn provides a very simple calling sequence for
the much more powerful LANCELOT B pcakage.  Its simplicity results from the
fact that \packagename\ completely ignores partial separability and sparsity
structure, limits the forms under which the problem can be presented to the
solver and only allows for a very restricted choice of algorithmic parameters.
It is therefore of interest mostly for small-dimensional problems for which
ease of interface matters more than numerical performance.

\galbasics

We consider the nonlinear minimization problem given by
\[
\min_{x \in \smallRe^n} f( x ),
\]
possibly subject to constraints of the one or more of the forms
\[
l \leq  \bmx \leq u,
\]
\[
c_e( \bmx )  = 0,
\]
\[
c_i( \bmx ) \leq 0,
\]
where $f: \Re^n \rightarrow \Re$, $c_e: \Re^n \rightarrow \Re^{m}$ and
$c_i: \Re^n \rightarrow \Re^{q}$ are twice-continuously differentiable
functions, and $l, u$ are vectors of $\Re^n$ whose components are allowed
to be arbitrarily large in absolute value.

The inequality constraints are first internally reformulated as equalities by
the introduction of (non-negative) slack variables. This defines the set
$\calC$ of all (original and reformulated) equality constraints. The method
used to solve this reformulated problem is iterative and features two levels of
iteration. In the outer level, a composite function, the augmented Lagrangian
merit function,
\eqn{objectiveb}{
\phi( \bmx, \bmy, \mu ) = f(\bmx) + \sum_{i \in \calC}
 y_i c_i (\bmx) + \frac{1}{2 \mu} \sum_{i\in \calC} [c_i (\bmx)]^2,
}
is formulated, where $\mu$ is known as the penalty parameter,  $\bmy$ is a
vector of Lagrange multiplier estimates and $c_i$ now ranges over all
(original and reformulated) equality constraints.  Each outer iteration
requires the approximate minimization of this merit function
within the feasible box, for given values of $\mu$ and $\bmy$.

The required approximate minimization for fixed $\mu$ and $\bmy$ is
carried out using a series of inner iterations.  At each inner
iteration, a quadratic model of the merit function is
constructed.  An approximation to the minimizer of this model within a
trust-region is calculated.  The trust region is a ``box''
of specified radius, centered at the current best estimate
of the minimizer.  If there is an accurate agreement between the model
and the true objective function at the new approximation to the
minimizer, this approximation becomes the new best estimate.  Otherwise,
the radius of the trust region is reduced and a new approximate
minimizer sought.  The algorithm also allows the trust-region radius to
increase when necessary. The minimization of the model function is
carried out by using an iterative approach.

The approximate minimization of the model is performed in two stages.
In the first, a so-called generalized Cauchy point is determined
by approximately minimizing the model within the intersection of
the feasible box and the trust-region along a scaled steepest descent
direction. Having taken this step, the model is further reduced
by solving one or more quadratic minimization problems in which
any constraints activated at the Cauchy point remain so. The latter
computation is essentially equivalent to the solution of a sequence
of linear systems, and is performed using an iterative (preconditioned
conjugate gradient) method.

After an appropriate approximation to the minimizer of the merit
function is obtained, and if there are general constraints,
$\mu$ and $\bmy$ are adjusted to ensure
convergence of the outer iteration to the required solution of the
constrained minimization problem.

\galhowto

\subsection{Calling sequences}

The package is available using both single and double precision reals, 
and either 32-bit or 64-bit integers. Access to the 32-bit integer,
single precision version requires the {\tt USE} statement
\medskip

\hspace{8mm} {\tt USE \fullpackagename\_single}

\medskip
\noindent
with the obvious substitution {\tt \fullpackagename\_double},
{\tt \fullpackagename\_single\_64} and 
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double\_64} for the other variants.

\noindent
If it is required to use more than one of the modules at the same time, 
the subroutine
{\tt \fullpackagename}
(Section~\ref{galarguments})
must be renamed on one of the {\tt USE} statements.

\realdp, whose $i$-th entry may be set
to the value of the upper bound $u_i$ on the $i$-th variable.

a large positive number.  It is not altered by the routine.

\itt{CNAMES} is an \optional\  rank-one array of dimension {\tt neq + nin }
and type default \character\ and length 10, whose $i$-th entry contains (on

iteration of the process, while additionally if {\tt print\_level} $= 2$
a summary of the inner iteration will be given.
If {\tt print\_level} $\geq 3$, this output will be
increased to provide significant detail of each iteration.
The default is {\tt print\_level = 1}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Function and derivative values\label{fdv}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem function evaluation %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Evaluating problem functions\label{pfe}}

{\tt LANCELOT\_simple} requires that the user provides a
subroutine, with prescribed argument lists, that accept input
values $(\bmx)$, and provide as output
$f(\bmx))$ or $c_i(\bmx)$ ($i \in \calC$).
This default routine name is {\tt FUN} and it must have the following argument
list:

\def\baselinestretch{0.8}
{\tt \begin{verbatim}
       SUBROUTINE FUN ( X, fx [,i] )
\end{verbatim} }\def\baselinestretch{1.0}
\noindent
where
\begin{description}
\itt{X} is a rank-one \intentin array argument of
dimension {\tt n} and type \realdp,
that contains the values of $\bmx$ at which the
subroutine is required to evaluate the values
of the objective or constraint functions.

\itt{fx} is a rank-one \intentout scalar argument of
  type \realdp, that contains the value of the relevant
  function evaluated at $\bmx$.

\itt{i} is an \optional\ scalar \intentin\ argument of type \integer,
that, if present, specifies the index of the constraint function to be
evaluated  ({\tt i = 1, ..., neq+nin}).  The values of {\tt i}
between 1 and {\tt neq} correspond to equality constraints, those between
{\tt neq+1} and {\tt neq+nin} to inequality constraints. If {\tt i} is not
present, this indicates that the value of the objective function must be
evaluated.
\end{description}

\noindent
The name of the function evaluation routine may be modified by the user
by specifying {\tt MY\_FUN} to a value different from {\tt FUN} in the calling
sequence, but the argument list of the associated subroutine must be identical
to that described above. Specifying  {\tt MY\_FUN = FUN} is redundant in the
calling sequence if the name of the function evaluation routine is {\tt FUN}
(but this explicit identification is nevertheless recommended for clarity).

\subsubsection{Evaluating the first derivatives of problem functions\label{pfg}}

If the first derivatives of the problem functions are available, which is
indicated by the specification of the \optional\ argument {\tt MY\_GRAD}, they
must be available for the objective function and all constraints.
{\tt LANCELOT\_simple} then requires that the user provide a subroutine, with
a  prescribed argument list, that accepts input values $(\bmx)$, and returns as
output  $\nabla_x f(\bmx)$,  $\nabla_x c_e(\bmx)$ or $\nabla_x c_i(\bmx)$.
This routine is specified by setting the value of the \optional\ argument
{\tt MY\_GRAD}. If one uses {\tt MY\_GRAD = GRAD} in the call to {\tt
  LANCELOT\_simple}, the {\tt GRAD} routine must have the following argument
list:

\def\baselinestretch{0.8}
{\tt \begin{verbatim}
       SUBROUTINE GRAD ( X, G [,i] )
\end{verbatim} }
\def\baselinestretch{1.0}
\noindent
where
\begin{description}
\itt{X} is a rank-one \intentin\ array argument of
dimension {\tt n} and type \realdp,
that contains the values of $\bmx$ at which the
subroutine is required to evaluate the gradient
of the objective or constraint function.

\itt{G} is a rank-one \intentout\ array argument of dimension {\tt n}  and
  type \realdp, that contains the value of the relevant
  gradient evaluated at $\bmx$.

\itt{i} is an \optional\ scalar \intentin\ argument of type \integer,
that, if present, specifies the index of the constraint function whose
gradient must be evaluated  ({\tt i = 1, ..., neq+nin}).  The values of {\tt i}
between 1 and {\tt neq} correspond to equality constraints, those between
{\tt neq+1} and {\tt neq+nin} to inequality constraints. If {\tt i} is not
present, this indicates that the gradient of the objective function must be
evaluated.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Evaluating the second derivatives of problem
functions\label{pfh}}

If the second derivatives of the problem functions are available, which is
indicated by the specification of the \optional\ argument {\tt HESS}, they must
be available for the objective function and all constraints. Moreover, first
derivatives must also be available for all problem functions, and must be
specified as indicated in Section~\ref{pfg}.
{\tt LANCELOT\_simple} then requires that the user provide a subroutine, with
a prescribed argument list, that accepts input values $(\bmx)$, and returns as
output  $\nabla_{xx}f(\bmx)$,  $\nabla_{xx}c_e(\bmx)$ or
$\nabla_{xx}c_i(\bmx)$. This routine is specified by setting the value of the
\optional\ argument {\tt MY\_HESS}. If one uses {\tt MY\_HESS = HESS} in the
call to {\tt LANCELOT\_simple}, the {\tt HESS} routine must have the following
argument list:

\def\baselinestretch{0.8}
{\tt \begin{verbatim}
       SUBROUTINE HESS ( X, H [,i] )
\end{verbatim} }
\def\baselinestretch{1.0}
\noindent
where
\begin{description}
\itt{X} is a rank-one \intentin\ array argument of
dimension {\tt n} and type \realdp,
that contains the value of $\bmx$ at which the
subroutine is required to evaluate the Hessian
of the objective or constraint function.

\itt{H} is a rank-one \intentout\ array argument of dimension {\tt n*(n+1)/2}
  and type \realdp, that contains the value of the relevant
  Hessian evaluated at $\bmx$. Only the ``upper triangular'' part of the
  required Hessians should be specified columnwise. In other words, the
  component of the Hessian with respect to  variables $p$ and $j$, with
  $p \leq j$, must be  placed in {\tt H( j*(j-1)/2 + p )}.

\itt{i} is an \optional\ scalar \intentin\ argument of type \integer,
that, if present, specifies the index of the constraint function whose
Hessian must be evaluated  ({\tt i = 1, ..., neq+nin}). The values of {\tt i}
between 1 and {\tt neq} correspond to equality constraints, those between
{\tt neq+1} and {\tt neq+nin} to inequality constraints.
If {\tt i} is not
present, this indicates that the Hessian of the objective function must be
evaluated.
\end{description}

\galerrors\label{serrors}

If {\tt exit\_code} is positive
on return from the solver, an error has been detected.
The user should correct the error and restart the minimization.
Possible values of {\tt exit\_code} and their consequences are:
\begin{description}
\itt{exit\_code $= 1.$} More than {\tt maxit} iterations have been
      performed. This is often a symptom of incorrectly programmed
      derivatives or of the preconditioner used being
      insufficiently effective. Recheck the derivatives.
      Otherwise, increase {\tt maxit} and re-enter \package\
      at the best point found so far.
\itt{exit\_code $= 2.$} The trust-region radius
      has become too small. This is
      often a symptom of incorrectly programmed derivatives
      or of requesting more accuracy in the projected gradient
      than is reasonable on the user's machine.
      If the projected gradient
      is small, the minimization
      has probably succeeded. Otherwise, recheck the derivatives.
\itt{exit\_code $= 3.$} The step taken during the current iteration is so
      small that
      no difference will be observed in the function values.
      This sometimes occurs when too much accuracy is required of
      the final gradient. If the projected gradient
      is small, the minimization has probably succeeded.
\itt{exit\_code $= 8.$} The problem does not appear to have a feasible
     solution. Check the constraints and try starting with a different
     initial value for $\bmx$.
\itt{exit\_code $= 15.$} The problem dimension
     {\tt n} is nonpositive. Ensure that {\tt n $>$ 0}.
\itt{exit\_code $= 19.$} One or both of the numbers of constraints
      {\tt neq} or {\tt nin} is negative. Ensure that both {\tt neq $\geq$ 0}
      and {\tt nin $\geq$ 0}.
\end{description}

\galinfo

The user is able to control the amount of intermediate printing
performed in the course of the minimization. Printing is under
the control of the parameter {\tt print\_level} and output is sent to
I/O unit number number 6. Possible values of {\tt print\_level} and the levels
of output produced are as follows.
\begin{description}
\itt{print\_level $\leq 0.$} No printing, except warning messages, will be
   performed.
\itt{print\_level $\geq 1.$} Details of the minimization function will be
   output. This includes the number of variables, and additional
   information on the internal data structures of the solver.

                 If the current iterate provides an acceptable
                 estimate of the minimizer of the augmented Lagrangian
                 function, the two-norm of the general constraints and
                 the current value of the penalty parameter are given.
\itt{print\_level $= 1.$} A simple one-line description of each iteration is
                 given. This includes the iteration number, the
                 number of derivative evaluations that have been
                 made, the number of conjugate-gradient iterations
                 that have been performed,
                 the current value of the augmented Lagrangian
                 function, the (two-) norm
                 of the projected gradient,
                 the ratio $\rho$ of actual to predicted decrease
                 in the augmented Lagrangian function value,
                 the current trust-region radius,
                 the norm of the step taken,
                 an indication of how the direct or iterative
                 method ended, the number of variables which lie
                 away from their bounds and the total time
                 spent on the minimization.
\itt{print\_level $= 2.$} In addition to the information output with
                 {\tt print\_level = 1},
                 a short description of the approximate solution
                 to the inner-iteration linear system is given.
                 Before a successful ({\tt exit\_code = 0}) exit, details of
                 the estimate of the minimizer and the
                 gradient of the augmented Lagrangian
                 function are given.
\itt{print\_level $= 3.$} A list of the current iteration number, the value
				 of the augmented Lagrangian function, the
                 number of derivative evaluations that have been
                 made, the (two-) norm
                 of the projected gradient,
                 the number of conjugate gradients
                 iterations that have been performed and the
                 current trust-region radius
                 are given, followed by the
                 current estimate of the minimizer.
                 The values of the reduction in the model of the
                 augmented Lagrangian function
                 and the actual reduction in this
                 function, together with their ratio, are also given.
                 Before a successful ({\tt exit\_code = 0}) exit, details of
                 the estimate of the minimizer and the
                 gradient of the augmented Lagrangian function are given.

                 If the current iterate also provides an acceptable
                 estimate of the minimizer of the augmented Lagrangian
                 function, values of the general constraints and

                 Full details of the approximate solution
                 to the inner-iteration linear system are also given.
                 This level of output is intended as a debugging aid

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% METHOD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmethod
The basic method implemented within {\tt \packagename} and LANCELOT B is
described in detail by Conn, Gould and Toint (1991).  The method used to solve
the inner iteration subproblem is described by Conn, Gould and Toint
(1988b).  Also see Chapter~3 of the {\sf LANCELOT A} manual.

The Lagrangian function associated with the objective function
and the general constraints is the
composite function \disp{\ell( \bmx, \bmy ) = f(\bmx) + \sum_{i \in
\calC} y_i c_i (\bmx).}  The scalars $y_i$ are known as Lagrange
multiplier estimates.  At a solution $\bmx^{\star}$ to the constrained
minimization problem, there are Lagrange multipliers $\bmy^{\star}$ for
which the components of the gradient of the Lagrangian function
$\partial \ell(\bmx^{\star}, \bmy^{\star}) / \partial x_i= 0$ whenever
the corresponding variable $x_i^{\star}$ lies strictly between its lower
and upper bounds.

The augmented Lagrangian function is the composite function
\eqn{objectivec}{\phi( \bmx, \bmy, \mu ) = \ell( \bmx, \bmy) +
 \frac{1}{2 \mu} \sum_{i \in \calC} [c_i (\bmx)]^2,}
where $\mu$ is known as the penalty parameter.  An inner iteration is
used to find an approximate minimizer of (\ref{objectivec}) within the
feasible box for fixed values of the penalty parameter and Lagrange
multiplier estimates. The outer iteration of {\tt \packagename}
automatically adjusts the penalty parameter and Lagrange multiplier
estimates to ensure convergence of these approximate minimizers to a
solution of the constrained optimization problem.

In the inner iteration, a step from the current estimate of the solution
is determined using a trust-region approach.  That is, a quadratic model
of the augmented Lagrangian function is approximately minimized within
the intersection of the constraint ``box'' and another convex region,
the trust-region.  This minimization is carried out in two stages.
Firstly, the so-called generalized Cauchy point for the quadratic
subproblem is found.  (The purpose of this point is to ensure that the
algorithm converges and that the set of bounds which are satisfied as
equations at the solution is rapidly identified.)  Thereafter an
improvement to the quadratic model is sought using either a
direct-matrix or truncated conjugate-gradient algorithm. The
trust-region size is increased if the reduction obtained in the
objective function is reasonable when compared with the reduction
predicted by the model and reduced otherwise.

The strategy for treating bound constraints is based on the usual
projection and is described in detail in Conn, Gould and Toint (1988a).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galexample
We now consider the small example problem
\[
\min_{x_1,x_2 } f( x_1, x_2 ) = 100 ( x_2 - x_1^2 )^2 + ( 1 - x_1 )^2,
\]
subject to the constraints
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
0  & \leq & x_1, \\
x_1 + 3x_2   - 3  &  = &  0,\\
x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 4 &  \leq & 0.
\end{array}
\]

\noindent
A simple Fortran program to use the interface on this problem is given as
follows.
