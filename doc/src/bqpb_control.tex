provides the indicator tolerance associated with the test
{\tt indicator\_type = 1}.

where $u$ is {\tt EPSILON(1.0)} ({\tt EPSILON(1.0D0)} in
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double}).

\itt{indicator\_tol\_pd}
is a scalar variable of type \realdp that

%\itt{remove\_dependencies} is a scalar variable of type
%default \logical, that must be set \true\ if the algorithm
%is to attempt to remove any linearly dependent constraints before
%solving the problem, and \false\ otherwise.
%We recommend removing linearly dependencies.
%The default is {\tt remove\_dependencies = .TRUE.}.

\itt{treat\_zero\_bounds\_as\_general} is a scalar variable of type
default \logical.
If it is set to \false, variables which
are only bounded on one side, and whose bound is zero,
will be recognised as non-negativities/non-positivities rather than simply as
lower- or upper-bounded variables.
If it is set to \true, any variable bound
$x_{j}^{l}$ or $x_{j}^{u}$ which has the value 0.0 will be
treated as if it had a general value.
Setting {\tt treat\_zero\_bounds\_as\_general} to \true\ has the advantage
that if a sequence of problems are reordered, then bounds which are
``accidentally'' zero will be considered to have the same structure as
those which are nonzero. However, {\tt \fullpackagename} is
able to take special advantage of non-negativities/non-positivities, so
if a single problem, or if a sequence of problems whose
bound structure is known not to change, is/are to be solved,
it will pay to set the variable to \false.
The default is {\tt treat\_zero\_bounds\_as\_general = .FALSE.}.

\itt{just\_feasible} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that

must be set \true\ if the user-provided estimates of the dual variables
should be replaced by estimates whose aim is to try to balance the
requirements of dual feasibility and complementary slackness,
and \false\ if users estimates are to be used.
The default is {\tt getdua = .FALSE.}.

\itt{puiseux} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
must be set \true\
if a Puiseux series will be used when extrapolating along the central path
and \false\ if a Taylor series is preferred.
We recommend using the Puiseux series unless the solution is known
to be non-degenerate.
The default is {\tt puiseux = .TRUE.}.

\itt{every\_order} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
must be set \true\
if every order of approximation up to {\tt series\_order} will be tried

will be used.
The default is {\tt every\_order = .TRUE.}.

\itt{feasol} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
should be set \true\
if the final solution obtained will be perturbed
so that variables close to their bounds are moved onto these bounds,
and \false\ otherwise.
The default is {\tt feasol = .FALSE.}.
%The default is {\tt feasol = .TRUE.}.

\itt{balance\_initial\_complentarity} is a scalar variable of type 
default \logical, that should be set \true\
if the initial complementarity is required to be balanced,
and \false\ otherwise.
The default is {\tt balance\_initial\_complentarity = .FALSE.}.

\itt{crossover} is a scalar variable of type default \logical,
that must be set \true\ if the solution is to be defined in terms
of linearly-independent constraints,
and  \false\ otherwise.
The default is {\tt crossover = .TRUE.}.

\itt{space\_critical} is a scalar variable of type default \logical,
that must be set \true\ if space is critical when allocating arrays
and  \false\ otherwise. The package may run faster if
{\tt space\_critical} is \false\ but at the possible expense of a larger
storage requirement. The default is {\tt space\_critical = .FALSE.}.

\itt{deallocate\_error\_fatal} is a scalar variable of type default \logical,
that must be set \true\ if the user wishes to terminate execution if
a deallocation  fails, and \false\ if an attempt to continue
will be made. The default is {\tt deallocate\_error\_fatal = .FALSE.}.

\itt{prefix} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 30, that may be used to provide a user-selected
character string to preface every line of printed output.
Specifically, each line of output will be prefaced by the string
{\tt prefix(2:LEN(TRIM(prefix))-1)},
thus ignoring the first and last non-null components of the
supplied string. If the user does not want to preface lines by such
a string, they may use the default {\tt prefix = ""}.

{\tt FDC\_control\_type}
