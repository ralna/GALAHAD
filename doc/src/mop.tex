%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary

{\tt \fullpackagename} is a suite of Fortran~90 procedures for
{\bf performing operations on/with a matrix $\mathbf{A}$} of derived data type {\tt
  SMT\_type} (Section~\ref{typesmt}), which allows for multiple storage
types~(Section~\ref{galmatrix}).  In particular, this package contains the following
subroutines for a given $m$ by $n$ matrix $\bmA$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item subroutine {\tt mop\_Ax} computes matrix-vector products of
    the form
    \disp{\bmr \gets \alpha \bmA\bmx + \beta \bmr \quad {\rm and}
          \quad
          \bmr \gets \alpha \bmA^T\bmx + \beta \bmr}
    for given scalars $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and vectors $\bmx
    \in \Re^n$ and $\bmr \in \Re^m$;
  \item subroutine {\tt mop\_getval} obtains the $(i,j)$-element of
    the matrix $\bmA$ for given integers $i$ and $j$;
  \item subroutine {\tt mop\_scaleA} scales the rows of $\bmA$ by a
    given vector $\bmu\in\Re^m$ and the columns by a vector $\bmv\in\Re^n$.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO USE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galhowto

The package is available using both single and double precision reals, 
and either 32-bit or 64-bit integers. Access to the 32-bit integer,
single precision version requires the {\tt USE} statement
\medskip

\hspace{8mm} {\tt USE \fullpackagename\_single}

\medskip
\noindent
with the obvious substitution {\tt \fullpackagename\_double},
{\tt \fullpackagename\_single\_64} and 
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double\_64} for the other variants.

\noindent
If it is required to use more than one of the modules at the same time, 
the derived types
{\tt SMT\_type} (Section~\ref{typesmt}) 
and the subroutines 
{\tt \packagename\_Ax}, {\tt \packagename\_getval}, and 
{\tt \packagename\_scaleA} (Sections~\ref{Ax}, \ref{getval},
\ref{scaleA}) must be renamed on one of the {\tt USE} statements.

%%%%%%%%%%% Matrix Storage Formats %%%%%%%%%%%

\galmatrix

The matrix $\bmA$ may be stored in a variety of input formats.

\subsubsection{Dense storage format}\label{dense}
The matrix $\bmA$ is stored as a compact 
dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
Component $n \ast (i-1) + j$ of the storage array {\tt A\%val} will hold the 
value $a_{ij}$ for $i = 1, \ldots , m$, $j = 1, \ldots , n$.
If $\bmA$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part 
$a_{ij}$ for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$) should be stored.  In this case
the lower triangle will be stored by rows, that is 
component $i \ast (i-1)/2 + j$ of the storage array {\tt A\%val}  
will hold the value $a_{ij}$ (and, by symmetry, $a_{ji}$)
for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$.

\subsubsection{Sparse co-ordinate storage format}\label{coordinate}
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored. For the $l$-th
entry of $\bmA$, its row index $i$, column index $j$ and value
$a_{ij}$ are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer arrays
{\tt A\%row}, {\tt A\%col} and real array {\tt A\%val}.  The order is
unimportant, but the total number of entries {\tt A\%ne} is also
required.  If $\bmA$ is symmetric, the same scheme is applicable,
except that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

\subsubsection{Sparse row-wise storage format}\label{rowwise}
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are
ordered so that those in row $i$ appear directly before those in row
$i+1$. For the $i$-th row of $\bmA$, the $i$-th component of a integer
array {\tt A\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while {\tt A\%ptr} $(m+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices $j$ and values $a_{ij}$ of the entries in the
$i$-th row are stored in components $l =$ {\tt A\%ptr}$(i)$, \ldots
,{\tt A\%ptr} $(i+1)-1$ of the integer array {\tt A\%col}, and real
array {\tt A\%val}, respectively.  If $\bmA$ is symmetric, the same
scheme is applicable, except that only the entries in the lower
triangle should be stored.

For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than 
its predecessor.

\subsubsection{Sparse column-wise storage format}\label{columnwise}
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are
ordered so that those in column $j$ appear directly before those in column
$j+1$. For the $j$-th column of $\bmA$, the $j$-th component of the integer
array {\tt A\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this column,
while {\tt A\%ptr} $(n+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The row indices $i$ and values $a_{ij}$ of the entries in the
$j$-th column are stored in components $l =$ {\tt A\%ptr}$(j)$, \ldots
,{\tt A\%ptr} $(j+1)-1$ of the integer array {\tt A\%row}, and real
array {\tt A\%val}, respectively.  If $\bmA$ is symmetric, the same
scheme is applicable, except that only the entries in the lower
triangle should be stored.

\subsubsection{Diagonal storage format}\label{diagonal}
If $\bmA$ is diagonal (i.e., $a_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \neq j
\leq n$) only the diagonals entries $a_{ii}$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$ should
be stored, and the first $n$ components of the array {\tt A\%val}
should be used for this purpose.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% kinds %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\input{kinds}

%%%%%%%%%%% derived type for holding A %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{The derived data type for holding the matrix $\bmA$}\label{typesmt}
The matrix $\bmA$ is stored using the derived data type {\tt SMT\_type}
whose components are:

\begin{description}

\ittf{m} is a scalar component of type \integer, 
that holds the number of rows in the matrix. 
 
\ittf{n} is a scalar component of type \integer, 
that holds the number of columns in the matrix. 
 
\ittf{ne} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that
holds the number of matrix entries.

\ittf{type} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \character, that
is used to indicate the matrix storage scheme used.  If the dense storage scheme 
(see Section~\ref{dense}) is used, 
the first five components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt DENSE}.
For the sparse co-ordinate scheme (see Section~\ref{coordinate}), 
the first ten components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt COORDINATE},  
for the sparse row-wise storage scheme (see Section~\ref{rowwise}),
the first fourteen components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS},
for the sparse column-wise storage scheme (see Section~\ref{columnwise}),
the first seventeen components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt SPARSE\_BY\_COLUMNS},
and for the diagonal storage scheme (see Section~\ref{diagonal}),
the first eight components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the
string {\tt DIAGONAL}.

For convenience, the procedure {\tt SMT\_put} 
may be used to allocate sufficient space and insert the required keyword
into {\tt H\%type}.
For example, if we wish to store $\bmA$ using the co-ordinate scheme,
we may simply
%\vspace*{-2mm}
{\tt 
\begin{verbatim}
        CALL SMT_put( A%type, 'COORDINATE' )
\end{verbatim}
}
%\vspace*{-4mm}
\noindent
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SMT} 
for further details on the use of {\tt SMT\_put}. 

\ittf{val} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \realdp\, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that holds the values of the entries. 
Each pair of off-diagonal entries $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$ of a {\em symmetric}
matrix $\bmA$ is represented as a single entry 
(see \S\ref{dense}--\ref{diagonal}).

\ittf{row} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the row indices of the entries 
(see \S~\ref{coordinate} and \ref{columnwise}).

\ittf{col} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the column indices of the entries
(see \S\ref{coordinate}--\ref{rowwise}).

\ittf{ptr} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer.
If sparse row-wise storage is used, then {\tt ptr} should be of
dimension at least {\tt m + 1} and should contain pointers to the
first entry in each row (see \S\ref{rowwise}). If sparse column-wise
storage is used, then {\tt ptr} should be of dimension at least {\tt n
  + 1} and should contain pointers to the first entry in each column (see
\S\ref{columnwise}).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galexample
Suppose we wish to perform the following operations.  We first compute
\disp{ \bmr \gets \alpha \bmA \bmx + \beta \bmr}
where
\disp{\bmA   = \mat{ccc}{1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6}, \quad
      \bmx   = \mat{c}{1 \\ 1 \\ 1}, \quad
      \bmr   = \mat{c}{3 \\ 3}, \quad
      \alpha = 3, \quad {\rm and} \quad
      \beta  = 2.}
Next we scale the rows of $\bmA$ by the vector $\bmu$ and columns of $\bmA$ by the
vector $\bmv$, where
\disp{\bmu = \mat{c}{\phantom{-}2 \\ -1} \quad {\rm and} \quad
      \bmv = \mat{c}{3 \\ 1 \\ 2}.}
In other words, we over-write the matrix $\bmA$ with the scaled matrix
whose $(i,j)$th element is $u_ia_{i,j}v_j$.  Finally, we retrieve the
$(1,2)$ element of the scaled matrix.
