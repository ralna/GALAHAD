%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary

{\tt \fullpackagename} is a suite of Fortran procedures for
sorting and permuting.  It includes two algorithms (heapsort and
quicksort) to sort integer and/or real vectors,
another to reorder a sparse matrix from co-ordinate to row format,
and a further three tools for in-place
permutation and permutation inversion.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO USE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galhowto

The package is available using both single and double precision reals, 
and either 32-bit or 64-bit integers. Access to the 32-bit integer,
single precision version requires the {\tt USE} statement
\medskip

\hspace{8mm} {\tt USE \fullpackagename\_single}

\medskip
\noindent
with the obvious substitution {\tt \fullpackagename\_double},
{\tt \fullpackagename\_single\_64} and 
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double\_64} for the other variants.

\noindent
If it is required to use more than one of the modules at the same time, 
the subroutines
{\tt \packagename\_inplace\_invert},
{\tt \packagename\_inplace\_permute},
{\tt \packagename\_inverse\_permute},
{\tt \packagename\_reorder\_by\_rows},
{\tt \packagename\_quicksort},
{\tt \packagename\_heapsort\_build} and
{\tt \packagename\_heapsort\_\-smallest},
(Section~\ref{galarguments})
must be renamed on one of the {\tt USE} statements.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% argument lists %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galarguments

There are seven procedures that may be called by the user.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The subroutine {\tt \packagename\_inplace\_invert} is used to invert a
permutation vector without resorting to extra storage.
\item The subroutine {\tt \packagename\_inplace\_permute} is used to apply
a given permutation to an integer vector and, optionally,
to a real vector, without resorting to extra storage.
\item The subroutine {\tt \packagename\_inverse\_permute} is used to apply
the inverse of a given permutation to an integer vector
and, optionally, to a real vector, without resorting to extra
storage.
\item The subroutine {\tt \packagename\_reorder\_by\_rows} is used to
reorder a sparse matrix from arbitary co-ordinate order to row
order, that is so that the entries for row $i$ appear directly before
those for row $i+1$.
\item The subroutine {\tt \packagename\_quicksort} is used to sort
a given integer/real vector {\bf in ascending order}, optionally applying the
same permutation to integer and/or to a real vector(s). It uses the
``quicksort'' algorithm (see Section~\ref{galmethod}).
\item The subroutine {\tt \packagename\_heapsort\_build} is used to initialize
a procedure to sort a vector of real numbers using
the ``heapsort'' algorithm (see Section~\ref{galmethod}).
\item The subroutine {\tt \packagename\_heapsort\_smallest} is used to find,
possibly repeatedly, the smallest component of a real vector to which {\tt
\packagename\_heapsort\_build} has been previously applied (see
Section~\ref{galmethod}). Successive application of this subroutine therefore
results in sorting the initial vector {\bf in ascending order}. Optionally,
the order may be reversed so that the entries are sorted in descending order
instead.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Note that the subroutines {\tt \packagename\_heapsort\_build}
and {\tt \packagename\_heapsort\_smallest} are particularly appropriate if
it is not known in advance how many successive smallest components of the
vector will be required as the heapsort method is
able to calculate the $k+1$-st smallest component efficiently
once it has determined the first $k$ smallest components.
If a complete sort is required, the Quicksort algorithm, {\tt
\packagename\_quicksort} may be preferred. Both methods are
guaranteed to sort all $n$ numbers in $O( n \log n )$ operations.

\noindent
We use square brackets {\tt [ ]} to indicate \optional\ arguments.

\subsubsection{In-place inversion of a permutation}

A permutation $p$ of size $n$ is a vector of $n$ integers ranging from 1 to $n$,
each integer in this range occurring exactly once. Its inverse is another
permutation $q$, also of size $n$, such that $q(p(i))=i$ for all $i=1,\ldots,n$.
Inverting a given permutation without resorting to extra storage is done as
follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_inplace\_invert ( n, p )}

\vspace*{-3mm}
\begin{description}
\itt{n} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type 
\integer, that must be set by the user to $n$, the size of the permutation to
be inverted.
{\bf Restriction:} ${\tt n} > 0$.

\itt{p} is a rank-one \intentinout\ array argument of
dimension at least {\tt n} and type either 
\integer\ or \realdp, that must be set by the user
on input so that its $i$-th component contains the integer $p(i)$.
On exit, the elements of {\tt p} will have overwritten by those of $q$, the
inverse of $p$.

\end{description}

\subsubsection{Applying a given permutation in place}

Applying a given permutation $p$ to a vector $x$ consists in modifying the
vector $x$ such that its $i$-th component appears (after applying the
permutation) in component $p(i)$.
This is done without resorting to extra storage as follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

{\tt CALL \packagename\_inplace\_permute ( n, p [, x] [, ix] [, iy] )}

\begin{description}
\itt{n} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type
\integer, that must be set by the user to $n$, the size of the permutation to
be applied.
{\bf Restriction:} ${\tt n} > 0$.

\itt{p} is a rank-one \intentinout\ array argument of
dimension at least {\tt n} and type either
\integer\ or \realdp, that must be set by the user
on input so that its $i$-th component contains the integer $p(i)$, that is the
$i$-th component of the permutation one wishes to apply.
It is unchanged on exit.

\itt{x} is an optional rank-one \intentinout\ array argument of
dimension at least {\tt n} and type \realdp, whose $n$ first components must
be set by the user. If {\tt x} is present, the component {\tt x(i)} will have
been replaced by {\tt x(p(i))} on exit.

\itt{ix} is an optional rank-one \intentinout\ array argument of
dimension at least {\tt n} and type \integer, whose $n$ fisrt components must
be set by the user. If {\tt ix} is present, the component {\tt ix(i)} will have
been replaced by {\tt ix(p(i))} on exit.

\itt{iy} is an optional rank-one \intentinout\ array argument of
dimension at least {\tt n} and type \integer, whose $n$ first components must
be set by the user. If {\tt iy} is present, the component {\tt iy(i)} will have
been replaced by {\tt iy(p(i))} on exit.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Applying the inverse of a given permutation in place}

Applying a the inverse of a given permutation $p$ to a vector $x$ consists in
modifying the vector $x$ such that its $i$-th component appears (after
applying the procedure) in component $q(i)$, where $q$ is the inverse of
$p$. Equivalently, this can be seen as modifying the vector $x$ such that its
$p(i)$-th component appears (after applying the procedure) in component $i$.
This is done without resorting to extra storage as follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

{\tt CALL \packagename\_inverse\_permute ( n, p [, x] [, ix] )}

\begin{description}
\itt{n} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type
\integer, that must be set by the user to $n$, the size of the permutation
whose inverse is to be applied.
{\bf Restriction:} ${\tt n} > 0$.

\itt{p} is a rank-one \intentinout\ array argument of
dimension at least {\tt n} and type either
\integer\ or \realdp, that must be set by the user
on input so that its $i$-th component contains the integer $p(i)$, that is the
$i$-th component of the permutation whose inverse is to be applied.
It is unchanged on exit.

\itt{x} is an optional rank-one \intentinout\ array argument of
dimension at least {\tt n} and type \realdp, whose $n$ first components must
be set by the user. If {\tt x} is present, the component {\tt x(i)} will have
been replaced by {\tt x(p(i))} on exit.

\itt{ix} is an optional rank-one \intentinout\ array argument of
dimension at least {\tt n} and type \integer, whose $n$ first components must
be set by the user. If {\tt ix} is present, the component {\tt ix(i)} will have
been replaced by {\tt ix(p(i))} on exit.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Reordering a sparse matrix from co-ordinate to row order}

The matrix $\bmA$ is reordered from co-ordinate to row order as follows:
\hskip0.5in
\def\baselinestretch{1.0} {\tt \begin{verbatim}
     CALL SORT_reorder_by_rows( nr, nc, nnz, A_row, A_col, la, A_val,  A_ptr, lptr,     &
                                IW, liw, error, warning, inform )

On exit, {\tt A\_ptr}$(i), i = 1, \ldots,$ {\tt nr} give
the starting addresses for the entries in {\tt A\_row}/{\tt A\_col}/{\tt A\_val}
in row $i$, while {\tt A\_ptr(nr+1)}
gives the index of the first non-occupied component of $\bmA$.

\end{description}

\subsubsection{Quicksort}

The vector $x$ is sorted in acending order as follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_quicksort ( n, x, inform [, ix ] [, rx] )}

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%% Forming the initial heap %%%%%%

\subsubsection{Heapsort}

\paragraph{Building the initial heap.}
The initial heap is constructed as follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_heapsort\_build ( n, x, inform [, ix, largest ] )}

\vspace*{-3mm}
\begin{description}
\itt{n} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type
\integer, that must be set by the user to $n$, the
number of entries of {\tt x} that are to be (partially) sorted.
{\bf Restriction:} ${\tt n} > 0$.

\itt{x} is a rank-one \intentinout\ array argument of
dimension at least {\tt n} and type either
\integer\ or \realdp, whose first {\tt n} components  must be set by
the user on input. On successful return, the elements of {\tt x} will have
been permuted so that they form a heap.

\itt{inform} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type \integer.
A successful call to {\tt \packagename\_heapsort\_build}
is indicated when {\tt inform} has the value 0 on exit.
For other return values of {\tt inform}, see Section~\ref{galerrors}.

\itt{ix} is an optional rank-one \intentinout\ array argument of
dimension at least {\tt n} and type \integer.
If {\tt ix} is present, exactly the same permutation is applied to the
components of {\tt ix} as to the components of {\tt x}.
For example, the inverse permutation will be
provided if {\tt ix(i)} is set to {\tt i,} for $i = 1, \ldots, n$
on entry.

\itt{largest} is an optional scalar \intentin\ argument
of type \integer.
If {\tt largest} is present and set to \true, the heap will be built so
that the largest entry is at the root, and thus the subsequent sort will
determine the largest entries in order. Otherwise, the heap will be
built with the smallest entry is at the root so that the sort will
find the smallest entries in order.
\end{description}

%%%%%%%%% Finding the smallest entry in the current heap %%%%%%

\paragraph{Finding the smallest entry in the current heap.}

To find the smallest entry in a given heap,
to place this entry at the end of the list of entries in the heap and
to form a new heap with the remaining entries:

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_heapsort\_smallest ( m, x, inform [, ix, largest ] )}

\vspace*{-3mm}
\begin{description}
\itt{m} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type
\integer, that must be set by the user to $m$, the
number of entries of {\tt x} that lie on the heap on entry.
{\bf Restriction:} ${\tt m} > 0$.

\itt{x} is a rank-one \intentinout\ array argument of
dimension at least {\tt m} and type either
\integer\ or \realdp\, whose first {\tt m} components must be set by
the user on input so that they form a heap.
In practice, this normally means that they have been placed on a heap
by a previous call to
{\tt \packagename\_heapsort\_build}
or
{\tt \packagename\_heapsort\_smallest}.
On output, the smallest of the first {\tt m} components of {\tt x} will have
been moved to position {\tt x(m)} and the remaining components will now occupy
locations $1,  2,  .... $ {\tt m-1} of {\tt x} and will again form a heap.

\itt{inform} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type \integer.
A successful call to {\tt \packagename\_heapsort\_smallest}
is indicated when {\tt inform} has the value 0 on exit.
For other return values of {\tt inform}, see Section~\ref{galerrors}.

\itt{ix} is an optional rank-one \intentinout\ array argument of
dimension at least {\tt m} and type \integer.
If {\tt ix} is present, exactly the same permutation is applied to the
components of {\tt ix} as to the components of {\tt x}.

\itt{largest} is an optional scalar \intentin\ argument
of type \integer.
If {\tt largest} is present and set to \true, the largest, rather than the
smallest, entry will be found and placed in {\tt x(m)} on exit, and
the remaining heap rebuilt

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%% Finding the k smallest components of a set of $n$ elements.  %%%%%%

\paragraph{Finding the $k$ smallest components of a set of $n$ elements.}

To find the $k$ smallest components of a set,
$\{ x_1 ,   x_2 ,  ...  ,  x_n \}$, of $n$ elements, the user should firstly
call {\tt \packagename\_heapsort\_build} with {\tt n} $= n$ and $x_1 $ to
$x_n $ stored in {\tt x(1)} to {\tt x(n).} This places the components of
{\tt x} on a heap. This should then be followed by $k$ calls of
{\tt \packagename\_heapsort\_smallest}, with
{\tt m} $= n - i + 1$ for $i  =  1,  ... ,   k$.
The required $k$ smallest values, in increasing order, will now
occupy positions $n - i + 1$ of {\tt x} for $i  =  1,  ... ,   k$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% METHOD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmethod

\subsection{Quicksort}

The quicksort method is due to C. A. R. Hoare (Computer Journal, {\bf 5 }
(1962), 10-15).

\noindent
The idea is to take one component of the vector to sort, say $x_1$, and to
move it to the final position it should occupy in the sorted vector, say
position $p$. While determining this final position, the other components are
also rearranged so that there will be none with smaller value to the left of
position $p$ and none with larger value to the right. Thus the original
sorting problem is transformed into the two disjoint subproblems of sorting the
first $p-1$ and the last $n-p$ components of the resulting vector. The same
technique is then applied recursively to each of these subproblems.
The method is likely to sort the vector $x$ in $O( n \log n )$ operations,
but may require as many as $O( n^2 )$ operations in extreme cases.

\subsection{Heapsort}

The heapsort method is due to J. W. J.  Williams (Algorithm 232,
Communications of the ACM
{\bf 7 } (1964), 347-348).  Subroutine {\tt \packagename\_heapsort\_build}
is a partial amalgamation of Williams' Algol procedures {\em setheap}
and {\em inheap} while {\tt \packagename\_heapsort\_smallest}
is based upon his procedures {\em outheap} and {\em swopheap}.

\noindent
The elements of the set $\{ x_1 ,   x_2 ,  ...  ,  x_n \}$
are first allocated to the nodes of a heap.  A heap is a binary
tree in which the element at each parent node has a numerical
value as small as or smaller than the elements at its two children.
The smallest value is
thus placed at the root of the tree. This value is now removed from
the heap and a subset of the remaining elements interchanged until a
new, smaller, heap is constructed.  The smallest value of the new heap
is now at the root and may be removed as described above. The elements
of the initial set may thus be arranged in order of increasing size,
the $i$-th largest element of the array being found in the $i$-th
sweep of the method.  The method is guaranteed to sort all $n$ numbers
in $O( n \log n )$ operations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galexample
The following example is a somewhat unnatural sequence of operations, but
illustrates the use of the {\tt \packagename} tools. It uses the data vector
\[
x = \{ x_1 ,   x_2 ,  ...  , x_{20} \} =
\{ -5,  -7,  ~2,  ~9,  ~0,  -3,  ~3,  ~5,  -2,  -6,
 ~8,  ~7,  -1,  -8,  ~10,  -4,  ~6,  -9,  ~1,  ~4 \}.
\]
Suppose now that we wish to perform the following successful operations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item sort the components of $x$ in ascending order and compute the associated
inverse permutation,
\item apply this permutation to the resulting vector (in order to recover its
original ordering),
\item restore the permutation to the identity by sorting its components in
ascending order,
\item find the 12 smallest components of $x$ and the associated inverse
permutation,
\item inverse this permutation (which yields the permutation used to sort the
12 smallest components),
\item
apply to the permuted $x$ the inverse of the this latest permutation (thus
recovering its original ordering again).
\end{enumerate}
Then we may use the following code:


{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageexample}
}
\noindent
This produces the following output:
