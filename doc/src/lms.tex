%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% derived types %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galtypes
Four derived data types are accessible from the package.

%%%%%%%%%%% control type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding control
 parameters}\label{typecontrol}
The derived data type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
is used to hold controlling data. Default values may be obtained by calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
(see \S\ref{subinit}),
while components may also be changed by calling
{\tt \fullpackagename\_read\-\_spec}
(see \S\ref{readspec}).
The components of
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
are:

\begin{description}

\itt{error} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that holds the
stream number for error messages. Printing of error messages in
{\tt \packagename\_setup}, {\tt \packagename\_apply}
and {\tt \packagename\_terminate}
is suppressed if {\tt error} $\leq 0$.
The default is {\tt error = 6}.

\ittf{out} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that holds the
stream number for informational messages. Printing of informational messages in
{\tt \packagename\_setup}, {\tt \packagename\_apply}
is suppressed if {\tt out} $< 0$.
The default is {\tt out = 6}.

\itt{print\_level} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that is used
to control the amount of informational output which is required. No
informational output will occur if {\tt print\_level} $\leq 0$. If
{\tt print\_level} $= 1$, a single line of output will be produced for each
level of the process. If {\tt print\_level} $\geq 2$, this output will be
increased to provide significant detail of the factorization.
The default is {\tt print\_level = 0}.

\itt{memory\_length} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that is used
to specify the maximum number of vectors  $\{\bms_k\}$ and $\{\bmy_k\}$
that will be used when building the secant approximation.
Any non-positive value will be interpreted as {\tt 1}.
The default is {\tt memory\_length = 10}.

\itt{method} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that is used
to specify the limited-memory formula that will be applied. Possible
values are
\begin{description}
\itt{1.} A limited-memory BFGS formula will be applied.
\itt{2.} A limited-memory symmetric rank-one formula will be applied.
\itt{3.} The inverse of the limited-memory BFGS formula will be applied.
\itt{4.} The inverse of the shifted limited-memory BFGS formula will be applied.
This should be used instead of {\tt \%method = 3} whenever a shift is
planned.
\end{description}
Any value outside this range will be interpreted as {1}.
The default is {\tt method = 1}.

\itt{any\_method} is a scalar variable of type default \logical,
that must be set \true\ if more than one method (see {\tt \%method} above)
is to be used and  \false\ otherwise. The package will require more
storage and may run slower if {\tt any\_method} is \true.
The default is {\tt any\_method = .FALSE.}.

\itt{space\_critical} is a scalar variable of type default \logical,
that must be set \true\ if space is critical when allocating arrays
and  \false\ otherwise. The package may run faster if
{\tt space\_critical} is \false\ but at the possible expense of a larger
storage requirement. The default is {\tt space\_critical = .FALSE.}.

\itt{deallocate\_error\_fatal} is a scalar variable of type default \logical,
that must be set \true\ if the user wishes to terminate execution if
a deallocation  fails, and \false\ if an attempt to continue
will be made. The default is {\tt deallocate\_error\_fatal = .FALSE.}.

\itt{prefix} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 30, that may be used to provide a user-selected
character string to preface every line of printed output.
Specifically, each line of output will be prefaced by the string
{\tt prefix(2:LEN(TRIM(prefix))-1)},
thus ignoring the first and last non-null components of the
supplied string. If the user does not want to preface lines by such
a string, they may use the default {\tt prefix = ""}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%% time type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding timing
 information}\label{typetime}
The derived data type
{\tt \packagename\_time\_type}
is used to hold elapsed CPU and system clock times for the various parts of
the calculation. The components of
{\tt \packagename\_time\_type}
are:
\begin{description}
\itt{total} is a scalar variable of type default \realdp, that gives
 the total CPU time spent in the package.

\itt{setup} is a scalar variable of type default \realdp, that gives
 the CPU time spent setting up the data structures to represent
 the limited-memory matrix.

\itt{form} is a scalar variable of type default \realdp, that gives
 the CPU time spent forming and updating the limited-memory matrix
as new data arrives.

\itt{apply} is a scalar variable of type default \realdp, that gives
 the CPU time spent applying the matrix to given vectors.

\itt{clock\_total} is a scalar variable of type default \realdp, that gives
 the total elapsed system clock time spent in the package.

\itt{clock\_setup} is a scalar variable of type default \realdp, that gives
 the elapsed system clock time spent setting up the data structures to
 represent the limited-memory matrix.

\itt{clock\_form} is a scalar variable of type default \realdp, that gives
 the elapsed system clock time spent forming and updating the limited-memory
 matrix as new data arrives.

\itt{clock\_apply} is a scalar variable of type default \realdp, that gives
 the elapsed system clock time spent  applying the matrix to given vectors.
factor $\bmR$.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%% inform type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding informational
 parameters}\label{typeinform}
The derived data type
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
is used to hold parameters that give information about the progress and needs
of the algorithm. The components of
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
are:

\begin{description}

\itt{status} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that gives the
exit status of the algorithm.
%See Sections~\ref{galerrors} and \ref{galinfo}
See \S\ref{galerrors}
for details.

\itt{alloc\_status} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that gives
the status of the last attempted array allocation or deallocation.
This will be 0 if {\tt status = 0}.

\itt{bad\_alloc} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 80, that  gives the name of the last internal array
for which there were allocation or deallocation errors.
This will be the null string if {\tt status = 0}.

\itt{length} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that
gives the number of pairs $\{\bms_k,\bmy_k\}$ currently used to represent the
limited-memory matrix

\itt{updates\_skipped} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
will be \true\ if one or more of the current pairs $\{\bms_k,\bmy_k\}$ has
been ignored for stability reasons when building the current limited-memory
matrix, and \false\ otherwise.

\ittf{time} is a scalar variable of type {\tt \packagename\_time\_type}
whose components are used to hold elapsed CPU and system clock times for
the various parts of the calculation (see Section~\ref{typetime}).

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%% data type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding problem data}\label{typedata}
The derived data type
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
is used to hold all the data for the problem and the workspace arrays
used to construct the multi-level incomplete factorization between calls of
{\tt \packagename} procedures.
This data should be preserved, untouched, from the initial call to
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
to the final call to
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% argument lists %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galarguments
There are seven procedures for user calls
(see \S\ref{galfeatures} for further features):

\begin{enumerate}
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_initialize}
      is used to set default values, and initialize private data,
      before solving one or more problems with the
      same sparsity and bound structure.
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_setup}
      is called to set up the data structures needed to represent
      the limited-memory matrix $\bmH_k$ or its inverse.
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_form}
      is called to form the limited-memory matrix $\bmH_k$ or its inverse
      as new data $(\bms_k,\bmy_k,\delta_k)$ arrives. The matrix
      $\bmH_k+ \lambda_k\bmI$ or its inverse for a specified shift
      $\lambda_k$ may be formed instead.
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_form\_shift}
      is called to update the inverse of the
      limited-memory matrix $\bmH_k+ \lambda_k\bmI$
      when a new shift $\lambda_k$ is required.
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_change\_method}
      is called to build the limited-memory matrices $\bmH_k$,
      $\bmH_k+ \lambda_k\bmI$ or their inverse
      for a new method from the current data.
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_apply}
      is called to form the product $\bmu = \bmH_k \bmv$,
      $\bmu = ( \bmH_k + \lambda_k \bmI ) \bmv$,
      $\bmu = \bmH_k^{-1} \bmv$ or
      $\bmu = ( \bmH_k + \lambda_k \bmI) ^{-1} \bmv$ for a given vector $\bmv$.
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_terminate}
      is provided to allow the user to automatically deallocate array
       components of the private data, allocated by
       {\tt \packagename\_setup}
       at the end of the solution process.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Further features %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galfeatures
\noindent In this section, we describe an alternative means of setting
control parameters, that is components of the variable {\tt control} of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see \S\ref{typecontrol}),
by reading an appropriate data specification file using the
subroutine {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}. This facility
is useful as it allows a user to change  {\tt \packagename} control parameters
without editing and recompiling programs that call {\tt \packagename}.

A specification file, or specfile, is a data file containing a number of
"specification commands". Each command occurs on a separate line,
and comprises a "keyword",
which is a string (in a close-to-natural language) used to identify a
control parameter, and
an (optional) "value", which defines the value to be assigned to the given
control parameter. All keywords and values are case insensitive,
keywords may be preceded by one or more blanks but
values must not contain blanks, and
each value must be separated from its keyword by at least one blank.
Values must not contain more than 30 characters, and
each line of the specfile is limited to 80 characters,
including the blanks separating keyword and value.

The portion of the specification file used by
{\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
must start
with a "{\tt BEGIN \packagename}" command and end with an
"{\tt END}" command.  The syntax of the specfile is thus defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  ( .. lines ignored by LMS_read_specfile .. )
    BEGIN LMS
       keyword    value
       .......    .....
       keyword    value
    END
  ( .. lines ignored by LMS_read_specfile .. )
\end{verbatim}
where keyword and value are two strings separated by (at least) one blank.
The ``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiter command lines
may contain additional (trailing) strings so long as such strings are
separated by one or more blanks, so that lines such as
\begin{verbatim}
    BEGIN LMS SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
    END LMS SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
are acceptable. Furthermore,
between the
``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiters,
specification commands may occur in any order.  Blank lines and
lines whose first non-blank character is {\tt !} or {\tt *} are ignored.
The content
of a line after a {\tt !} or {\tt *} character is also
ignored (as is the {\tt !} or {\tt *}
character itself). This provides an easy manner to "comment out" some
specification commands, or to comment specific values
of certain control parameters.

The value of a control parameters may be of three different types, namely
integer, logical or real.
Integer and real values may be expressed in any relevant Fortran integer and
floating-point formats (respectively). Permitted values for logical
parameters are "{\tt ON}", "{\tt TRUE}", "{\tt .TRUE.}", "{\tt T}",
"{\tt YES}", "{\tt Y}", or "{\tt OFF}", "{\tt NO}",
"{\tt N}", "{\tt FALSE}", "{\tt .FALSE.}" and "{\tt F}".
Empty values are also allowed for
logical control parameters, and are interpreted as "{\tt TRUE}".

The specification file must be open for
input when {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
is called, and the associated device number
passed to the routine in device (see below).
Note that the corresponding
file is {\tt REWIND}ed, which makes it possible to combine the specifications
for more than one program/routine.  For the same reason, the file is not
closed by {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}.

\subsubsection{To read control parameters from a specification file}
\label{readspec}

Control parameters may be read from a file as follows:

\def\baselinestretch{0.8}
{\tt
\begin{verbatim}
     CALL LMS_read_specfile( control, device )
\end{verbatim}
}

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentinout argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see \S\ref{typecontrol}).
Default values should have already been set, perhaps by calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, individual components of {\tt control} may have been changed
according to the commands found in the specfile. Specfile commands and
the component (see \S\ref{typecontrol}) of {\tt control}
that each affects are given in Table~\ref{specfile}.

\itt{device} is a scalar \intentin argument of type default \integer,
that must be set to the unit number on which the specfile
has been opened. If {\tt device} is not open, {\tt control} will
not be altered and execution will continue, but an error message
will be printed on unit {\tt control\%error}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% METHOD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmethod

Given a sequence of vectors $\{\bms_k\}$ and $\{\bmy_k\}$ and scale factors
$\delta_k$, a limited-memory secant approximation $\bmH_k$ is chosen so that
$\bmH_{\max(k-m,0)} = \delta_k \bmI$, $\bmH_{k-j} \bms_{k-j} = \bmy_{k-j}$
and $\| \bmH_{k-j+1} - \bmH_{k-j}\|$ is ``small'' for
$j = \min(k-1,m-1), \ldots, 0$.
Different ways of quantifying ``small'' distinguish different methods,
but the crucial
observation is that it is possible to construct $\bmH_k$ quickly from
$\{\bms_k\}$, $\{\bmy_k\}$ and $\delta_k$, and to apply it and its inverse
to a given vector $\bmv$. It is also possible to apply similar formulae
to the ``shifted'' matrix $\bmH_k + \lambda_k \bmI$ that occurs in
trust-region methods.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galexample
Suppose that we generate random vectors $\{\bms_k\}$ and $\{\bmy_k\}$
and scale factors $\delta_k$, that we build the limited-memory BFGS
matrix $\bmH_k$ and its inverse $\bmH_k^{-1}$ and that we apply
$\bmH_k$ and then $\bmH_k^{-1}$ to a given vector $\bmv$. Suppose further,
that at some stage, we instead apply the inverse $(\bmH_k+\lambda_k\bmI)^{-1}$
with $\lambda_k = 0$. Then we may use the following code; of course since
we have the identities $\bmv = \bmH_k^{-1} ( \bmH_k \bmv )$ and
$\bmv = ( \bmH_k + \lambda_k \bmI) ^{-1} ( \bmH_k \bmv )$ when $\lambda_k = 0$,
we expect to recover the original $\bmv$ after every step:
