%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary
This package uses a primal-dual interior-point method
to solve the {\bf convex quadratic programming problem}
\eqn{qp}{\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(\bmx) = \half \bmx^T \bmH \bmx + \bmg^T \bmx + f}
or the {\bf shifted least-distance problem}
\eqn{lsqp}{\mbox{minimize}\;\;
 \half \sum_{j=1}^n w_j^2 ( x_j^{ } - x_j^0 )^2 + \bmg^T \bmx + f}
subject to the general linear constraints
\disp{c_{i}^{l}  \leq  \bma_{i}^{T}\bmx  \leq  c_{i}^{u}, \;\;\;
 i = 1, \ldots , m,}
and the simple bound constraints
\disp{x_{j}^{l}  \leq  x_{j}^{ } \leq  x_{j}^{u} , \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,}
where the $n$ by $n$ symmetric, positive-semi-definite matrix $\bmH$, the
vectors $\bmg$, $\bmw$, $\bmx^{0}$,
$\bma_{i}$, $\bmc^{l}$, $\bmc^{u}$, $\bmx^{l}$,
$\bmx^{u}$ and the scalar $f$ are given.
Any of the constraint bounds $c_{i}^{l}$, $c_{i}^{u}$,
$x_{j}^{l}$ and $x_{j}^{u}$ may be infinite.
Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrix $\bmH$
or the matrix $\bmA$ of vectors $\bma_{i}$.

\galhowto

%\subsection{Calling sequences}

The package is available using both single and double precision reals, 
and either 32-bit or 64-bit integers. Access to the 32-bit integer,
single precision version requires the {\tt USE} statement
\medskip

\hspace{8mm} {\tt USE \fullpackagename\_single}

\medskip
\noindent
with the obvious substitution {\tt \fullpackagename\_double},
{\tt \fullpackagename\_single\_64} and 
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double\_64} for the other variants.

\noindent

(Section~\ref{galfeatures})
must be renamed on one of the {\tt USE} statements.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% matrix formats %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmatrix
Both the Hessian matrix $\bmH$ and
the constraint Jacobian $\bmA$, the matrix
whose rows are the vectors $\bma_{i}^{T}$, $i = 1, \ldots , m$,
may be stored in a variety of input formats.

\subsubsection{Dense storage format}\label{dense}
The matrix $\bmA$ is stored as a compact
dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
Component $n \ast (i-1) + j$ of the storage array {\tt A\%val} will hold the
value $a_{ij}$ for $i = 1, \ldots , m$, $j = 1, \ldots , n$.
Since $\bmH$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
$h_{ij}$ for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$) need be held. In this case
the lower triangle will be stored by rows, that is
component $i \ast (i-1)/2 + j$ of the storage array {\tt H\%val}
will hold the value $h_{ij}$ (and, by symmetry, $h_{ji}$)
for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$.

\subsubsection{Sparse co-ordinate storage format}\label{coordinate}
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored. For the
$l$-th entry of $\bmA$, its row index $i$, column index $j$
and value $a_{ij}$
are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer arrays {\tt A\%row},
{\tt A\%col} and real array {\tt A\%val}, respectively.
The order is unimportant, but the total
number of entries {\tt A\%ne} is also required.
The same scheme is applicable to
$\bmH$ (thus requiring integer arrays {\tt H\%row}, {\tt H\%col}, a real array
{\tt H\%val} and an integer value {\tt H\%ne}),
except that only the entries in the lower triangle need be stored.

\subsubsection{Sparse row-wise storage format}\label{rowwise}
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in row $i$ appear directly before those
in row $i+1$. For the $i$-th row of $\bmA$, the $i$-th component of a
integer array {\tt A\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while {\tt A\%ptr} $(m+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices $j$ and values $a_{ij}$ of the entries in the $i$-th row
are stored in components
$l =$ {\tt A\%ptr}$(i)$, \ldots ,{\tt A\%ptr} $(i+1)-1$ of the
integer array {\tt A\%col}, and real array {\tt A\%val}, respectively.
The same scheme is applicable to
$\bmH$ (thus requiring integer arrays {\tt H\%ptr}, {\tt H\%col}, and
a real array {\tt H\%val}),
except that only the entries in the lower triangle need be stored.

For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
its predecessor.

\subsubsection{Diagonal storage format}\label{diagonal}
If $\bmH$ is diagonal (i.e., $h_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \neq j \leq n$)
only the diagonals entries $h_{ii}$, $1 \leq i \leq n$,  need be stored,
and the first $n$ components of the array {\tt H\%val} may be used for
the purpose. There is no sensible equivalent for the non-square $\bmA$.

\subsubsection{Scaled-identity-matrix storage format}\label{scaled-identity}
If $\bmH$ is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix
(i.e., $h_{ii} = h_{11}$  and $h_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \neq j \leq n$)
only the first diagonal entry $h_{11}$ needs be stored,
and the first component of the array {\tt H\%val} may be used for
the purpose. Again, there is no sensible equivalent for the non-square $\bmA$.

\subsubsection{Identity-matrix storage format}\label{identity}
If $\bmH$ is the identity matrix
(i.e., $h_{ii} = 1$ and $h_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \neq j \leq n$),
no explicit entries needs be stored.

\subsubsection{Zero-matrix storage format}\label{zero}
If $\bmH = \bmzero$ (i.e., $h_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i, j \leq n$),
no explicit entries needs be stored.

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding matrices}\label{typesmt}

and $\bmH$.
The components of {\tt SMT\_TYPE} used here are:

\begin{description}

\ittf{m} is a scalar component of type \integer,
that holds the number of rows in the matrix.

\ittf{n} is a scalar component of type \integer,
that holds the number of columns in the matrix.

\ittf{ne} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that
holds the number of matrix entries.

\ittf{type} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \character, that

and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that holds the values of the entries.
Each pair of off-diagonal entries $h_{ij} = h_{ji}$ of a {\em symmetric}

(see \S\ref{dense}--\ref{rowwise}).
Any duplicated entries that appear in the sparse
co-ordinate or row-wise schemes will be summed.

and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the row indices of the entries.
(see \S\ref{coordinate}).

\ittf{col} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer,
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may the column indices of the entries

and dimension at least {\tt m + 1}, that may hold the pointers to
the first entry in each row (see \S\ref{rowwise}).

may be used to allocate sufficient space and insert the required keyword
into {\tt A\%type}.
Once again, if {\tt prob} is of derived type {\tt \packagename\_problem\_type}
and involves a Jacobian we wish to store using the sparse row-wise
storage scheme, we may simply

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Warning and error messages %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galerrors
A negative value of {\tt inform\%status} on exit from
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
or
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}
indicates that an error has occurred. No further calls should be made
until the error has been corrected. Possible values are:

\begin{description}

\itt{\galerrallocate.} An allocation error occurred. A message indicating
the offending
array is written on unit {\tt control\%error}, and the returned allocation
status and a string containing the name of the offending array
are held in {\tt inform\%alloc\_\-status}
and {\tt inform\%bad\_alloc} respectively.

\itt{\galerrdeallocate.} A deallocation error occurred.
A message indicating the offending
array is written on unit {\tt control\%error} and the returned allocation
status and a string containing the name of the offending array
are held in {\tt inform\%alloc\_\-status}
and {\tt inform\%bad\_alloc} respectively.

\itt{\galerrrestrictions.} One of the restrictions
 {\tt prob\%n} $> 0$ ,  {\tt prob\%m} $\geq 0$
    the requirement that {\tt prob\%A\_type} contain its relevant string
    {\tt 'DENSE'}, {\tt 'COORDINATE'} or {\tt 'SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS'},

    {\tt prob\%H\_type} contain its relevant string
    {\tt 'DENSE'}, {\tt 'COORDINATE'}, {\tt 'SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS'},
    {\tt 'DIAGONAL'}  {\tt SCALED\_IDENTITY}, {\tt IDENTITY} or {\tt ZERO},
    when $\bmH$ is available, has been violated.

% {\tt prob\%A\_val}, {\tt prob\%A\_row}, {\tt prob\%A\_col},
% {\tt prob\%H\_val}, {\tt prob\%H\_row} or {\tt prob\%H\_col},
% is not large enough to hold the original, or reordered, matrix $\bmH$.

\itt{\galerrbadbounds.} The bound constraints are inconsistent.

\itt{\galerrprimalinfeasible.} The constraints appear to have no feasible point.

\itt{\galerrunbounded.} The objective function appears to be unbounded
  from below on the feasible set.

\itt{\galerranalysis.} The analysis phase of the factorization failed;
  the return status from the factorization
    package is given in the component {\tt inform\%fac\-t\-or\_status}.

\itt{\galerrfactorization.} The factorization failed; the return status
  from the factorization

    {\tt control\%maxit} is too small, but may also be symptomatic of
    a badly scaled problem.

\itt{\galerrcpulimit.} The elapsed CPU or system clock time limit has been
    reached. This may happen if either {\tt control\%cpu\_time\_limit} or

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Further features %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galfeatures
\noindent In this section, we describe an alternative means of setting
control parameters, that is components of the variable {\tt control} of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}),
by reading an appropriate data specification file using the
subroutine {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}. This facility
is useful as it allows a user to change  {\tt \packagename} control parameters
without editing and recompiling programs that call {\tt \packagename}.

A specification file, or specfile, is a data file containing a number of
"specification commands". Each command occurs on a separate line,
and comprises a "keyword",
which is a string (in a close-to-natural language) used to identify a
control parameter, and
an (optional) "value", which defines the value to be assigned to the given
control parameter. All keywords and values are case insensitive,
keywords may be preceded by one or more blanks but
values must not contain blanks, and
each value must be separated from its keyword by at least one blank.
Values must not contain more than 30 characters, and
each line of the specfile is limited to 80 characters,
including the blanks separating keyword and value.



The portion of the specification file used by
{\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
must start
with a "{\tt BEGIN \packagename}" command and end with an
"{\tt END}" command.  The syntax of the specfile is thus defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  ( .. lines ignored by CQP_read_specfile .. )
    BEGIN CQP
       keyword    value
       .......    .....
       keyword    value
    END
  ( .. lines ignored by CQP_read_specfile .. )
\end{verbatim}
where keyword and value are two strings separated by (at least) one blank.
The ``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiter command lines
may contain additional (trailing) strings so long as such strings are
separated by one or more blanks, so that lines such as
\begin{verbatim}
    BEGIN CQP SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
    END CQP SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
are acceptable. Furthermore,
between the
``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiters,
specification commands may occur in any order.  Blank lines and
lines whose first non-blank character is {\tt !} or {\tt *} are ignored.
The content
of a line after a {\tt !} or {\tt *} character is also
ignored (as is the {\tt !} or {\tt *}
character itself). This provides an easy manner to "comment out" some
specification commands, or to comment specific values
of certain control parameters.

The value of a control parameters may be of three different types, namely
integer, logical or real.
Integer and real values may be expressed in any relevant Fortran integer and
floating-point formats (respectively). Permitted values for logical
parameters are "{\tt ON}", "{\tt TRUE}", "{\tt .TRUE.}", "{\tt T}",
"{\tt YES}", "{\tt Y}", or "{\tt OFF}", "{\tt NO}",
"{\tt N}", "{\tt FALSE}", "{\tt .FALSE.}" and "{\tt F}".
Empty values are also allowed for
logical control parameters, and are interpreted as "{\tt TRUE}".

The specification file must be open for
input when {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
is called, and the associated device number
passed to the routine in device (see below).
Note that the corresponding
file is {\tt REWIND}ed, which makes it possible to combine the specifications
for more than one program/routine.  For the same reason, the file is not
closed by {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}.

\subsubsection{To read control parameters from a specification file}
\label{readspec}

Control parameters may be read from a file as follows:
\hskip0.5in

\def\baselinestretch{0.8}

\end{verbatim}
}
\def\baselinestretch{1.0}

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentinout argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}).
Default values should have already been set, perhaps by calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, individual components of {\tt control} may have been changed
according to the commands found in the specfile. Specfile commands and
the component (see Section~\ref{typecontrol}) of {\tt control}
that each affects are given in Table~\ref{specfile}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Information printed %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galinfo
If {\tt control\%print\_level} is positive, information about the progress
of the algorithm will be printed on unit {\tt control\-\%out}.
If {\tt control\%print\_level} $= 1$, a single line of output will be produced
for each iteration of the process.
For the initial-feasible-point phase,
this will include values of the current primal and dual infeasibility, and
violation of complementary slackness, the feasibility-phase objective value,
the current steplength, the value of the barrier parameter, the
number of backtracks in the linesearch and the elapsed CPU time in seconds.
Once a suitable feasible point has been found, the iteration is divided
into major iterations, at which the barrier parameter is reduced, and
minor iterations, and which the barrier function is approximately minimized
for the current value of the barrier parameter. For the major iterations,
the value of the barrier parameter, the required values of
dual feasibility and violation of complementary slackness, and the current
constraint infeasibility are reported. Each minor iteration of the
optimality phase results in a line giving
the current dual feasibility and violation of complementary slackness, the
objective function value, the ratio of predicted to achieved reduction
of the objective function, the trust-region radius, the
number of backtracks in the linesearch, the number of conjugate-gradient
iterations taken, and the elapsed CPU time in seconds.

If {\tt control\%print\_level} $\geq 2$ this
output will be increased to provide significant detail of each iteration.
This extra output includes residuals of the linear systems solved, and,
for larger values of {\tt control\%print\_level}, values of the primal and dual
variables and Lagrange multipliers.

and
\eqn{4.1b}{
 \bmc^{l} \leq \bmc \leq \bmc^{u}, \;\;

 (\mbox{or} \;\; \bmW^{2} (\bmx -\bmx^{0}) + \bmg =
 \bmA^{T} \bmy + \bmz \;\; \mbox{for the least-distance type objective})}
where
\eqn{4.2b}{
 \bmy = \bmy^{l} + \bmy^{u}, \;\;
 \bmz = \bmz^{l} + \bmz^{u}, \,\,
 \bmy^{l} \geq 0 , \;\;
 \bmy^{u} \leq 0 , \;\;
 \bmz^{l} \geq 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\;
 \bmz^{u} \leq 0 ,}
and the complementary slackness conditions
\eqn{4.3}{
( \bmA \bmx - \bmc^{l} )^{T} \bmy^{l} = 0  ,\;\;
( \bmA \bmx - \bmc^{u} )^{T} \bmy^{u} = 0  ,\;\;
(\bmx -\bmx^{l} )^{T} \bmz^{l} = 0   \tim{and}
(\bmx -\bmx^{u} )^{T} \bmz^{u} = 0 ,}
where the diagonal matrix $\bmW^{2}$ has diagonal entries $w_{j}^{2}$,
$j = 1, \ldots , n$, where the vectors $\bmy$ and $\bmz$ are
known as the Lagrange multipliers for
the general linear constraints, and the dual variables for the bounds,
respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold component-wise.

Primal-dual interior point methods iterate towards a point
that satisfies these conditions by ultimately aiming to satisfy
\req{4.1a}, \req{4.2a} and \req{4.3}, while ensuring that
\req{4.1b} and \req{4.2b} are
satisfied as strict inequalities at each stage.
Appropriate norms of the amounts by
which \req{4.1a}, \req{4.2a} and \req{4.3} fail to be satisfied are known as the
primal and dual infeasibility, and the violation of complementary slackness,
respectively. The fact that \req{4.1b} and \req{4.2b} are satisfied as strict
inequalities gives such methods their other title, namely
interior-point methods.

The method aims at each stage to reduce the
overall violation of \req{4.1a}, \req{4.2a} and \req{4.3},
rather than reducing each of the terms individually. Given an estimate
$\bmv = (\bmx, \; \bmc, \; \bmy, \; \bmy^{l}, \;
\bmy^{u}, \; \bmz, \; \bmz^{l}, \; \bmz^{u})$
of the primal-dual variables, a correction
$\Delta \bmv = \Delta (\bmx, \; \bmc, \; \bmy, \; \bmy^{l},
 \; \bmy^{u} ,\;\bmz,\;\bmz^{l} ,\;\bmz^{u} )$
is obtained by solving a suitable linear system of Newton equations for the
nonlinear systems \req{4.1a}, \req{4.2a} and a parameterized ``residual
trajectory'' perturbation of \req{4.3}; residual trajectories
proposed by Zhang (1994) and Zhao and Sun (1999) are possibilities.
An improved estimate $\bmv + \alpha \Delta \bmv$
is then used, where the step-size $\alpha$
is chosen as close to 1.0 as possible while ensuring both that
\req{4.1b} and \req{4.2b} continue to hold and that the individual components
which make up the complementary slackness
\req{4.3} do not deviate too significantly
from their average value. The parameter that controls the perturbation
of \req{4.3} is ultimately driven to zero.

If the algorithm believes that it is close to the solution, it may take a
speculative ``pounce'' extrapolation, based on an estimate of the ultimate 
active set, to avoid further costly iterations. If the pounce is unsuccessful, 
the iteration continues, but further pounces may be attempted later.

The Newton equations are solved  by applying the
\galahad\ matrix factorization package
{\tt GALAHAD\_SBLS}, but there are options
to factorize the matrix as a whole (the so-called "augmented system"
approach), to perform a block elimination first (the "Schur-complement"
approach), or to let the method itself decide which of the two
previous options is more appropriate.
The "Schur-complement" approach is usually to be preferred when all the
weights are nonzero or when every variable is bounded (at least one side),
but may be inefficient if any of the columns of $\bmA$ is too dense.

Optionally, the problem may be pre-processed temporarily to eliminate dependent
constraints using the package {\tt GALAHAD\_FDC}. This may improve the
performance of the subsequent iteration.

 \bmA = \mat{ccc}{ 2 & 1 & \\ & 1 & 1},\;\;
 \bmc^{l} = \vect{ 1 \\ 2 }, \tim{and}
 \bmc^{u} = \vect{ 2 \\ 2 }}
in sparse co-ordinate format, we may use the following code:

{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageexample}
}
\noindent
This produces the following output:
{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageresults}
}
\noindent
The same problem may be solved holding the data in
a sparse row-wise storage format by replacing the relevant lines in
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
!  sparse co-ordinate storage format
...
! problem data complete
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
by
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
! sparse row-wise storage format
   CALL SMT_put( p%H%type, 'SPARSE_BY_ROWS', s )     ! Specify sparse row
   CALL SMT_put( p%A%type, 'SPARSE_BY_ROWS', s )     ! storage for H and A
   ALLOCATE( p%H%val( h_ne ), p%H%col( h_ne ), p%H%ptr( n + 1 ) )
   ALLOCATE( p%A%val( a_ne ), p%A%col( a_ne ), p%A%ptr( m + 1 ) )
   p%H%val = (/ 1.0_wp, 2.0_wp, 1.0_wp, 3.0_wp /) ! Hessian H
   p%H%col = (/ 1, 2, 2, 3 /)                     ! NB lower triangle
   p%H%ptr = (/ 1, 2, 3, 5 /)
   p%A%val = (/ 2.0_wp, 1.0_wp, 1.0_wp, 1.0_wp /) ! Jacobian A
   p%A%col = (/ 1, 2, 2, 3 /)
   p%A%ptr = (/ 1, 3, 5 /)
! problem data complete
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
or using a dense storage format with the replacement lines
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
!  dense storage format
   CALL SMT_put( p%H%type, 'DENSE', s )     ! Specify dense
   CALL SMT_put( p%A%type, 'DENSE', s )     ! storage for H and A
   ALLOCATE( p%H%val( n * ( n + 1 ) / 2 ) )
   ALLOCATE( p%A%val( n * m ) )
   p%H%val = (/ 1.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 2.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 1.0_wp, 3.0_wp /) ! Hessian H
   p%A%val = (/ 2.0_wp, 1.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 1.0_wp, 1.0_wp /) ! Jacobian A
! problem data complete
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
respectively.

If instead $\bmH$ had been the diagonal matrix
\disp{\bmH = \mat{ccc}{1 & &   \\ & 2 & \\  &  & 3}}
but the other data is as before, the diagonal storage scheme
might be used for $\bmH$, and in this case we would instead
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
   CALL SMT_put( prob%H%type, 'DIAGONAL', s )  ! Specify dense storage for H
   ALLOCATE( p%H%val( n ) )
   p%H%val = (/ 1.0_wp, 2.0_wp, 3.0_wp /) ! Hessian values
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
%Notice here that zero diagonal entries are stored.
