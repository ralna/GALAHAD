%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary
Given real $n$ by $n$ symmetric matrices $\bmH$ and $\bmM$
(with $\bmM$ diagonally dominant), another real $m$ by $n$ matrix $\bmA$,
a real $n$ vector $\bmc$ and scalars $\Delta>0$ and $f$, this package finds a
{\bf global minimizer of the quadratic objective function
$\half \bmx^T \bmH \bmx  +  \bmc^T \bmx + f$, where the vector $\bmx$ is
required to satisfy the constraint $\|\bmx\|_{\bmM} \leq  \Delta$
and possibly $\bmA \bmx = \bmzero$}, and
where the $\bmM$-norm of $\bmx$ is $\|\bmx\|_{\bmM} = \sqrt{\bmx^T \bmM \bmx}$.
This problem commonly occurs as a trust-region subproblem in nonlinear
optimization calculations.
The package may also be used to solve the related problem in which $\bmx$ is
instead required to satisfy the
{\bf equality constraint $\|\bmx\|_{\bmM} = \Delta$}.
The matrix $\bmM$ need not be provided in the commonly-occurring
$\ell_2$-trust-region case for which $\bmM = \bmI$, the $n$ by $n$
identity matrix.

\noindent
Factorization of matrices of the form $\bmH + \lambda \bmM$---or
\eqn{kkt}{\mat{cc}{ \bmH + \lambda \bmM & \bmA^T \\ \bmA & \bmzero}}
in cases where $\bmA \bmx = \bmzero$ is imposed---for a succession
of scalars $\lambda$ will be required, so this package is most suited
for the case where such a factorization may be found efficiently. If
this is not the case, the package {\tt \libraryname\_GLTR} may be preferred.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% matrix formats %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmatrix
The matrices $\bmH$ and (if required) $\bmM$ and $\bmA$
may be stored in a variety of input formats.

\subsubsection{Dense storage format}\label{dense}
The matrix $\bmH$ is stored as a compact
dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
Since $\bmH$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
$h_{ij}$ for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$) need be held. In this case
the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
component $i \ast (i-1)/2 + j$ of the storage array {\tt H\%val}
will hold the value $h_{ij}$ (and, by symmetry, $h_{ji}$)
for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$. The same is true for $\bmM$ if it is used.
If $\bmA$ is used, the entire matrix must be supplied, and
component $n \ast (i-1) + j$ of the storage array {\tt A\%val} will hold the
value $a_{ij}$ for $i = 1, \ldots , m$, $j = 1, \ldots , n$.

\subsubsection{Sparse co-ordinate storage format}\label{coordinate}
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
For the $l$-th entry of $\bmH$, $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$,
its row index $i$, column index $j$ and value $h_{ij}$
are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer arrays {\tt H\%row},
{\tt H\%col} and real array {\tt H\%val}, respectively.
Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
The same scheme may be used for $\bmM$ if it is required.
If $\bmA$ is used, the entire matrix must be supplied using the same scheme
in the integer arrays {\tt A\%row}, {\tt A\%col} and real array {\tt A\%val}.

\subsubsection{Sparse row-wise storage format}\label{rowwise}
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in row $i$ appear directly before those
in row $i+1$. For the $i$-th row of $\bmH$, the $i$-th component of the
integer array {\tt H\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while {\tt H\%ptr} $(m+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices $j$, $1 \leq j \leq i$, and values $h_{ij}$ of the
entries in the $i$-th row are stored in components
$l =$ {\tt H\%ptr}$(i)$, \ldots ,{\tt H\%ptr} $(i+1)-1$ of the
integer array {\tt H\%col}, and real array {\tt H\%val}, respectively.
Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
its predecessor.
This scheme may also be used for $\bmM$ and $\bmA$ if they are required,
excepting that for $\bmA$ the whole matrix must be stored.

\subsubsection{Diagonal storage format}\label{diagonal}
If $\bmH$ is diagonal (i.e., $h_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \neq j \leq n$)
only the diagonals entries $h_{ii}$, $1 \leq i \leq n$,  need be stored,
and the first $n$ components of the array {\tt H\%val} may be used for
the purpose. The same applies to $\bmM$ if it is required.
This scheme is inappropriate and thus unavailable for $\bmA$.

\subsection{Integer kinds}\label{Integer kinds}
We use the term
long \integer\ to denote {\tt INTEGER\-(kind=long)}, where
{\tt long = selected\_int\_kind(18))}.

Six derived data types are accessible from the package.

%%%%%%%%%%% matrix data type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding matrices}\label{typesmt}
The derived data type {\tt SMT\_TYPE} is used to hold the matrices $\bmH$
and perhaps $\bmM$ and/or $\bmA$.
The components of {\tt SMT\_TYPE} used here are:

\begin{description}

\ittf{m} is a scalar component of type default \integer,
that holds the number of rows in the matrix.

\ittf{n} is a scalar component of type default \integer,
that holds the number of columns in the matrix.

\ittf{ne} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that
holds the number of matrix entries.

\ittf{type} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \character, that
is used to indicate the matrix storage scheme used. Its precise length and
content depends on the type of matrix to be stored.

\ittf{val} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \realdp\,
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that holds the values of the entries.
Each pair of off-diagonal entries $h_{ij} = h_{ji}$ of the {\em symmetric}
matrix $\bmH$ is represented as a single entry
(see \S\ref{dense}--\ref{rowwise}).
Any duplicated entries that appear in the sparse
co-ordinate or row-wise schemes will be summed.

and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the row indices of the entries.
(see \S\ref{coordinate}).

\ittf{col} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \integer,
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the column indices of the entries
(see \S\ref{coordinate}--\ref{rowwise}).

\ittf{ptr} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \integer,
and dimension at least {\tt n + 1}, that may holds the pointers to
the first entry in each row (see \S\ref{rowwise}).

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%% control type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding control
 parameters}\label{typecontrol}
The derived data type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
is used to hold controlling data. Default values may be obtained by calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
(see Section~\ref{subinit}). The components of
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
are:

\begin{description}
\itt{error} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that holds the
stream number for error messages.
Printing of error messages in
{\tt \packagename\_solve} and {\tt \packagename\_terminate}
is suppressed if ${\tt error} \leq {\tt 0}$.
The default is {\tt error = 6}.

\ittf{out} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that holds the
stream number for informational messages.
Printing of informational messages in
{\tt \packagename\_solve} is suppressed if ${\tt out} < {\tt 0}$.
The default is {\tt out = 6}.

\itt{print\_level} is a scalar variable of type default \integer,
that is used
to control the amount of informational output which is required. No
informational output will occur if ${\tt print\_level} \leq {\tt 0}$. If
{\tt print\_level = 1} a single line of output will be produced for each
iteration of the process. If {\tt print\_level} $\geq$ {\tt 2} this output
will be increased to provide significant detail of each iteration.
The default is {\tt print\_level = 0}.

\itt{dense\_factorization} is a scalar variable of type default \integer,
that is used to indicate whether the problem should be treated as dense
and solved using dense-factorization methods. Possible values are:
\begin{description}
\itt{0} the problem should be considered as sparse.
\itt{1} the problem should be considered as dense.
\itt{other} the algorithm will decide whether to treat the
problem as dense or sparse depending on its dimension and the
sparsity of the matrices involved.
\end{description}
The default is {\tt dense\_factorization = 0}.

\itt{new\_h} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that is used
to indicate how $\bmH$ has changed (if at all) since the previous call
to {\tt \packagename\_solve}. Possible values are:
\begin{description}
\itt{0} $\bmH$ is unchanged.
\itt{1} the values in $\bmH$ have changed, but its nonzero structure
is as before.
\itt{2} both the values and structure of $\bmH$ have changed.
\end{description}
The default is {\tt new\_h = 2}.

\itt{new\_m} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that is used
to indicate how $\bmM$ (if required) has changed (if at all) since the previous
call to {\tt \packagename\_solve}. Possible values are:
\begin{description}
\itt{0} $\bmM$ is unchanged.
\itt{1} the values in $\bmM$ have changed, but its nonzero structure
is as before.
\itt{2} both the values and structure of $\bmM$ have changed.
\end{description}
The default is {\tt new\_m = 2}.

\itt{new\_a} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that is used
to indicate how $\bmA$ (if required) has changed (if at all) since the previous
call to {\tt \packagename\_solve}. Possible values are:
\begin{description}
\itt{0} $\bmA$ is unchanged.
\itt{1} the values in $\bmA$ have changed, but its nonzero structure
is as before.
\itt{2} both the values and structure of $\bmA$ have changed.
\end{description}
The default is {\tt new\_a = 2}.

\itt{max\_factorizations} is a scalar variable of type default \integer,
that holds the maximum number of factorizations which will be permitted.
If {\tt max\_factorizations} is set to a negative number, there will be
no limit on the number of factorizations allowed.
The default is {\tt max\_factorizations = -1}.

\itt{inverse\_itmax} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that holds
the maximum number of inverse iterations which will be allowed per step
when estimating the leftmost eigenvalue in {\tt \packagename\_solve}.
If {\tt inverse\_itmax} is set to a non-positive number, it will be reset by
{\tt \packagename\_solve} to 2.
The default is {\tt inverse\_itmax = 2}.

\itt{taylor\_max\_degree} is a scalar variable of type default \integer,
that specifies the maximum degree of Taylor approximant that will be used
to approximate the secular function when trying to improve $\lambda$;
a first-degree approximant results in Newton's method.
The higher the degree, the better in general the improvement, but the larger the
cost. Thus there is a balance between many cheap low-degree approximants
and a few more expensive higher-degree ones. Our experience favours
higher-degree approximants.
The default is {\tt taylor\_max\_degree = 3}, which is the highest degree
currently supported.

\itt{initial\_multiplier} is a scalar variables of type \realdp, that should
be set to an initial estimate of the required multiplier $\lambda_*$
(see Section~\ref{galmethod}). The algorithm will only use this value
if {\tt \%use\_initial\_multiplier} is set \true\ (see below), and otherwise
will be reset by {\tt \packagename\_solve}. A good initial estimate
may sometimes dramatically improve the performance of the package.
The default is {\tt initial\_multiplier = 0.0}.

\itt{lower} is a scalar variables of type \realdp, that holds the value
of any known lower bound on the required multiplier $\lambda_*$. A good lower
bound may sometimes dramatically improve the performance of the package, but
an incorrect value might cause the method to fail. Thus resetting
{\tt lower} from its default should be used with caution.
The default is {\tt lower = - HUGE(1.0)}
({\tt -HUGE(1.0D0)} in {\tt \fullpackagename\_double}).

\itt{upper} is a scalar variables of type \realdp, that holds the value
of any known upper bound on the required multiplier $\lambda_*$. A good upper
bound may sometimes dramatically improve the performance of the package, but
an incorrect value might cause the method to fail. Thus resetting
{\tt upper} from its default should be used with caution.
The default is {\tt upper = HUGE(1.0)}
({\tt HUGE(1.0D0)} in {\tt \fullpackagename\_double}).

\itt{stop\_normal,} {\tt stop\_absolute\_normal}
and {\tt stop\_hard} are scalar variables of type \realdp,
that hold values for the standard convergence tolerances of the method
(see Section~\ref{galmethod}).
In particular, the method is deemed to have converged when the
computed solution $\bmx$ and its multiplier $\lambda$ satisfy either
$\lambda = 0$ and $|\|\bmx\|_{\bmM} < \Delta$ or
$\|\bmx\|_{\bmM} -  \Delta| \leq \max($ {\tt stop\_normal} $\ast \; \Delta,$
{\tt stop\_absolute\_normal}$)$ or
$\lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny U}} - \lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny L}}
\leq$ {\tt stop\_hard} $\ast \; \max( 1, | \lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny L}} |,
| \lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny U}} | )$, where
$\lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny L}}$ and
$\lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny U}}$ are computed lower and upper bounds
on the optimal multiplier $\lambda_*$.
The defaults are {\tt stop\_normal = \tt stop\_absolute\_normal = stop\_hard =}
$u^{0.75}$,
where $u$ is {\tt EPSILON(1.0)} ({\tt EPSILON(1.0D0)} in
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double}).

\itt{start\_invit\_tol} is a scalar variable of type \realdp, that holds the
value of the starting tolerance for inverse iteration.
Specifically, inverse iteration is started as soon as
$\lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny U}} - \lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny L}}
\leq$ {\tt start\_invit\_tol} $\ast \;
 \max( | \lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny L}} |,
 | \lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny U}} | )$, where
$\lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny L}}$ and
$\lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny U}}$ are computed lower and upper bounds
on the optimal multiplier $\lambda_*$.
The default is {\tt start\_invit\_tol = 0.5}.

\itt{start\_invitmax\_tol} is a scalar variables of type \realdp, that holds the
value of the starting tolerance for full inverse iteration. Specifically,
Specifically, {\tt inverse\_itmax} steps of inverse iteration are
started as soon as
$\lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny U}} - \lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny L}}
\leq$ {\tt start\_invitmax\_tol} $\ast \;
 \max( | \lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny L}} |,
 | \lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny U}} | )$, where
$\lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny L}}$ and
$\lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny U}}$ are computed lower and upper bounds
on the optimal multiplier $\lambda_*$.
The default is {\tt start\_invitmax\_tol = 0.1}.

\itt{equality\_problem} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
may be set \true\ if the user requires that the solution
occur on the constraint boundary (i.e., that the inequality constraint be
replaced by $\|\bmx\|_{\bmM} = \Delta$), and \false\ otherwise.
The default is {\tt equality\_problem = \false}.

\itt{use\_initial\_multiplier} is a scalar variable of type default \logical,
that may be set \true\ if the user wishes to use the value of initial
multiplier supplied in {\tt \%initial\_multiplier},
and \false\ if the initial value will be chosen automatically.
The default is {\tt use\_initial\_multiplier = \false}.

\itt{initialize\_approx\_eigenvector} is a scalar variable of type default
\logical, that be should set \true\ if the user wishes the package to choose an
initial estimate of the eigenvector corresponding to the leftmost eigenvalue of
the matrix pencil $(\bmH,\bmM)$ in the null-space of $\bmA$.
If the eigenvector corresponding to the previous
problem (if any) might be useful, {\tt initial\_approx\_eigenvector}
should be set \false.
The default is {\tt initialize\_approx\_eigenvector = \true}.

\itt{force\_Newton} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
may be set \true\ if the user wishes the package to ignore the
trust-region bound when $\bmH$ is positive definite, and thus to compute
the Newton step in this case, and \false\ otherwise.
The default is {\tt force\_Newton = \false}.

\itt{space\_critical} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
may be set \true\ if the user wishes the package to allocate as little
internal storage as possible, and \false\ otherwise. The package may
be more efficient if {\tt space\_critical} is set \false.
The default is {\tt space\_critical = \false}.

\itt{deallocate\_error\_fatal} is a scalar variable of type default \logical,
that may be set \true\ if the user wishes the package to return to the user
in the unlikely event that an internal array deallocation fails,
and \false\ if the package should be allowed to try to continue.
The default is {\tt deallocate\_error\_fatal = \false}.

\itt{symmetric\_linear\_solver} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 30, that specifies the external package to be used to
solve any symmetric linear system that might arise. Current possible
choices are {\tt 'sils'}, {\tt 'ma27'}, {\tt 'ma57'}, {\tt 'ma77'},
{\tt 'ma86'}, {\tt 'ma97'}, {\tt ssids}, {\tt 'pardiso'}
and {\tt 'wsmp'},
although only {\tt 'sils'} and, for OMP 4.0-compliant compilers,
{\tt 'ssids'} are installed by default.
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SLS} for further details.
The default is {\tt symmetric\_linear\_solver = 'sils'}.

\itt{definite\_linear\_solver} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 30, that specifies the external package to be used to
solve any symmetric positive-definite linear system that might arise.
Current possible
choices are {\tt 'sils'}, {\tt 'ma27'}, {\tt 'ma57'}, {\tt 'ma77'},
{\tt 'ma86'}, {\tt 'ma87'}, {\tt 'ma97'}, {\tt ssids}, {\tt 'pardiso'}
and {\tt 'wsmp'},
although only {\tt 'sils'} and, for OMP 4.0-compliant compilers,
{\tt 'ssids'} are installed by default.
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SLS} for further details.
The default is {\tt definite\_linear\_solver = 'sils'}.

\itt{prefix} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 30, that may be used to provide a user-selected
character string to preface every line of printed output.
Specifically, each line of output will be prefaced by the string
{\tt prefix(2:LEN(TRIM(prefix))-1)},
thus ignoring the first and last non-null components of the
supplied string. If the user does not want to preface lines by such
a string, they may use the default {\tt prefix = ""}.

{\tt SLS\_control\_type} that is used to control various aspects of the
factorization package {\tt SLS}. See the documentation for
{\tt \libraryname\_SLS} for more details.

iterative refinement package {\tt IR}. See the documentation for

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding problem data}\label{typedata}

{\tt \packagename} procedures.
This data should be preserved, untouched, from the initial call to

to the final call to

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% argument lists %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galarguments
There are three procedures for user calls
(see Section~\ref{galfeatures} for further features):

\begin{enumerate}
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_initialize}
      is used to set default values and initialize private data.
\item The subroutine

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Warning and error messages %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galerrors
A negative value of  {\tt inform\%status} on exit from
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
or
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}
indicates that an error might have occurred. No further calls should be made
until the error has been corrected. Possible values are:

\begin{description}
\itt{\galerrallocate.} An allocation error occurred. A message indicating
the offending
array is written on unit {\tt control\%error}, and the returned allocation
status and a string containing the name of the offending array
are held in {\tt inform\%alloc\_\-status}
and {\tt inform\%bad\_alloc}, respectively.

\itt{\galerrdeallocate.} A deallocation error occurred.
A message indicating the offending
array is written on unit {\tt control\%error} and the returned allocation
status and a string containing the name of the offending array
are held in {\tt inform\%alloc\_\-status}
and {\tt inform\%bad\_alloc}, respectively.

\itt{\galerrrestrictions.} ({\tt \packagename\_solve} only)
One of the restrictions
{\tt n > 0}
or
{\tt radius > 0}
has been violated.

\itt{\galerranalysis.} ({\tt \packagename\_solve} only)
The analysis phase of the factorization of the matrix \req{kkt} failed.

\itt{\galerrfactorization.} ({\tt \packagename\_solve} only)
The factorization of the matrix \req{kkt} failed.

\itt{\galerrpreconditioner.} ({\tt \packagename\_solve} only)
The matrix $\bmM$ appears not to be diagonally dominant.

\itt{\galerrillconditioned.} ({\tt \packagename\_solve} only)
The problem is so ill-conditioned that further progress is impossible.

\itt{\galerrmaxiterations.} ({\tt \packagename\_solve} only)
 Too many factorizations have been required.  This may happen if
    {\tt control\%max\_factorizations} is too small,
    but may also be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Further features %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galfeatures
\noindent In this section, we describe an alternative means of setting
control parameters, that is components of the variable {\tt control} of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}),
by reading an appropriate data specification file using the
subroutine {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}. This facility
is useful as it allows a user to change  {\tt \packagename} control parameters
without editing and recompiling programs that call {\tt \packagename}.

A specification file, or specfile, is a data file containing a number of
"specification commands". Each command occurs on a separate line,
and comprises a "keyword",
which is a string (in a close-to-natural language) used to identify a
control parameter, and
an (optional) "value", which defines the value to be assigned to the given
control parameter. All keywords and values are case insensitive,
keywords may be preceded by one or more blanks but
values must not contain blanks, and
each value must be separated from its keyword by at least one blank.
Values must not contain more than 30 characters, and
each line of the specfile is limited to 80 characters,
including the blanks separating keyword and value.

The portion of the specification file used by
{\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
must start
with a "{\tt BEGIN \packagename}" command and end with an
"{\tt END}" command.  The syntax of the specfile is thus defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  ( .. lines ignored by TRS_read_specfile .. )
    BEGIN TRS
       keyword    value
       .......    .....
       keyword    value
    END
  ( .. lines ignored by TRS_read_specfile .. )
\end{verbatim}
where keyword and value are two strings separated by (at least) one blank.
The ``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiter command lines
may contain additional (trailing) strings so long as such strings are
separated by one or more blanks, so that lines such as
\begin{verbatim}
    BEGIN TRS SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
    END TRS SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
are acceptable. Furthermore,
between the
``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiters,
specification commands may occur in any order.  Blank lines and
lines whose first non-blank character is {\tt !} or {\tt *} are ignored.
The content
of a line after a {\tt !} or {\tt *} character is also
ignored (as is the {\tt !} or {\tt *}
character itself). This provides an easy manner to "comment out" some
specification commands, or to comment specific values
of certain control parameters.

The value of a control parameters may be of three different types, namely
integer, logical or real.
Integer and real values may be expressed in any relevant Fortran integer and
floating-point formats (respectively). Permitted values for logical
parameters are "{\tt ON}", "{\tt TRUE}", "{\tt .TRUE.}", "{\tt T}",
"{\tt YES}", "{\tt Y}", or "{\tt OFF}", "{\tt NO}",
"{\tt N}", "{\tt FALSE}", "{\tt .FALSE.}" and "{\tt F}".
Empty values are also allowed for
logical control parameters, and are interpreted as "{\tt TRUE}".

The specification file must be open for
input when {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
is called, and the associated device number
passed to the routine in device (see below).
Note that the corresponding
file is {\tt REWIND}ed, which makes it possible to combine the specifications
for more than one program/routine.  For the same reason, the file is not
closed by {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}.

Control parameters corresponding to the components
{\tt SLS\_control}
and
{\tt IR\_control} may be changed by including additional sections enclosed by
``{\tt BEGIN SLS}'' and
``{\tt END SLS}'', and
``{\tt BEGIN IR}'' and
``{\tt END IR}'', respectively.
See the specification sheets for the packages
{\tt \libraryname\_SLS}
and
{\tt \libraryname\_IR}
for further details.

\subsubsection{To read control parameters from a specification file}
\label{readspec}

Control parameters may be read from a file as follows:
\hskip0.5in
\def\baselinestretch{0.8} {\tt \begin{verbatim}
     CALL TRS_read_specfile( control, device )
\end{verbatim}}
\def\baselinestretch{1.0}

\begin{description}
\itt{control} is a scalar \intentinout argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}).
Default values should have already been set, perhaps by calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, individual components of {\tt control} may have been changed
according to the commands found in the specfile. Specfile commands and
the component (see Section~\ref{typecontrol}) of {\tt control}
that each affects are given in Table~\ref{specfile}.

\itt{device} is a scalar \intentin argument of type default \integer,
that must be set to the unit number on which the specfile
has been opened. If {\tt device} is not open, {\tt control} will

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Information printed %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galinfo
If {\tt control\%print\_level} is positive, information about the progress
of the algorithm will be printed on unit {\tt control\-\%\-out}.
If {\tt control\%print\_level = 1}, a single line of output will be produced
for each iteration of the process. In the first phase of the algorithm,
this will include the current estimate of the multiplier and known
brackets on its optimal value. In the second phase, the residual
$\|\bmx\|_{\bmM} - \Delta$, the current estimate of the multiplier and
the size of the correction will be printed.
If {\tt control\%print\_level} $\geq$ {\tt 2}, this
output will be increased to provide significant detail of each iteration.
This extra output includes times for various phases.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% METHOD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmethod
The required solution $\bmx_*$ necessarily satisfies the optimality condition
$\bmH \bmx_* + \lambda_* \bmM \bmx_* + \bmA^T \bmy_* + \bmc = \bmzero$ and
$\bmA \bmx_* = 0$, where $\lambda_* \geq 0$ is a Lagrange
multiplier corresponding to the constraint $\|\bmx\|_{\bmM}  \leq  \Delta$
and $\bmy_*$ are Lagrange multipliers for the linear constraints 
$\bmA \bmx = 0$, if any;
for the equality-constrained problem $\|\bmx\|_{\bmM} = \Delta$,
the multiplier is unconstrained.
In addition in all cases, the matrix $\bmH + \lambda_* \bmM$ will be positive
semi-definite on the null-space of $\bmA$; in most instances it will actually
be positive definite, but in special ``hard'' cases singularity is a 
possibility.

\noindent
The method is iterative, and proceeds in two phases.
Firstly, lower and upper bounds, $\lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny L}}$ and
$\lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny U}}$, on $\lambda_*$ are computed
using Gershgorin's theorems and other eigenvalue bounds. The
first phase of the computation proceeds by progressively shrinking  the bound
interval $[\lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny L}},\lambda_{\mbox{\protect\tiny U}}]$
until a value $\lambda$ for which
$\|\bmx(\lambda)\|_{\bmM}  \geq  \Delta$ is found.
Here $\bmx(\lambda)$ and its companion $\bmy(\lambda)$
are defined to be a solution of
\eqn{ls}{(\bmH + \lambda \bmM)\bmx(\lambda)
 + \bmA^T \bmy(\lambda) = - \bmc \tim{and} \bmA \bmx(\lambda) = \bmzero;}
along the way the possibility that $\bmH$ might be positive definite on
the null-space of $\bmA$ and
$\|\bmx(0)\|_{\bmM}  \leq  \Delta$ is examined, and if this transpires
the process is terminated with $\bmx_* = \bmx(0)$.
Once the terminating $\lambda$ from the first phase has been discovered,
the second phase
consists of applying Newton or higher-order iterations to the nonlinear
``secular'' equation $\|\bmx(\lambda)\|_{\bmM}  =  \Delta$ with
the knowledge that such iterations are both globally and ultimately
rapidly convergent. It is possible in the ``hard'' case that the
interval in the first-phase will shrink to the single point $\lambda_*$,
and precautions are taken, using inverse iteration with Rayleigh-quotient
acceleration to ensure that this too happens rapidly.

The dominant cost is the requirement that we solve a sequence of linear systems
\req{ls}. In the absence of linear constraints, an
efficient sparse Cholesky factorization with precautions to
detect indefinite $\bmH + \lambda \bmM$ is used. If $\bmA \bmx  = 0$ is required,
a sparse symmetric, indefinite factorization of \req{kkt} is used
rather than a Cholesky factorization.

If we now add the constraint $\bigsum_{i=1}^{10000} x_i = 0$,
for which $\bmA = ( 1 \;\; \ldots \;\; 1 )$, but revert to unit
($\bmM = \bmI$) trust-region, we may solve the
resulting problem using the following code:

This produces the following output:
