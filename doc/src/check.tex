%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary
This package uses finite difference approximations to {\bf check the gradient of an objective
  function $f(\bmx)$, the Jacobian matrix of a constraint function $\bmc(\bmx)$, and the
  second derivative Hessian matrix of the Lagrangian function $L(\bmx,\bmy) = f(\bmx) -
  \bmc(\bmx)^T \bmy$}.  These quantities are typically associated with a nonlinear
optimization problem
\disp{\mbox{minimize}\;\; f(\bmx)}
subject to the general linear constraints
\disp{a_{i}^{l}  \leq  \bma_{i}^{T}\bmx  \leq  a_{i}^{u}, \;\;\; i = 1, \ldots , m_a,}
general nonlinear constraints
\disp{c_{i}^{l}  \leq  c_{i}(\bmx)  \leq  c_{i}^{u}, \;\;\; i = 1, \ldots , m,}
and simple bound constraints
\disp{x_{j}^{l}  \leq  x_{j}^{ } \leq  x_{j}^{u} , \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,}
where the vectors $\bma_{i}$, $\bma^{l}$, $\bma^{u}$, $\bmc^{l}$,
$\bmc^{u}$, $\bmx^{l}$, and $\bmx^{u}$ are given, and the vectors
$\bmx\in\Re^n$ and $\bmy\in\Re^m$ are known as the primal and dual (Lagrange
multiplier) vectors, respectively.  The user may choose to perform a ``cheap''
verification of the requested derivatives, or a more detailed
and ``expensive'' check.  Function values can be supplied via internal
subroutine evaluation or reverse communication.

%\subsection{Calling sequences}

The package is available using both single and double precision reals, 
and either 32-bit or 64-bit integers. Access to the 32-bit integer,
single precision version requires the {\tt USE} statement
\medskip

\hspace{8mm} {\tt USE \fullpackagename\_single}

\medskip
\noindent
with the obvious substitution {\tt \fullpackagename\_double},
{\tt \fullpackagename\_single\_64} and 
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double\_64} for the other variants.

\noindent

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% matrix formats %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmatrix
The Jacobian matrix $\bmJ = \nabla_x\bmc(\bmx)$ and the Hessian matrix $\bmH = \nabla_{xx} L(\bmx,\bmy)$
may be stored in a variety of input formats.

\subsubsection{Dense storage format}\label{dense}
The matrix $\bmJ$ is stored as a compact 
dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
Component $n \ast (i-1) + j$ of the storage array {\tt J\%val} will hold the 
value $j_{ij}$ for $i = 1, \ldots , m$ and $j = 1, \ldots , n$.
Since $\bmH$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part 
$h_{ij}$ for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$) should be stored.  In this case
the lower triangle will be stored by rows, that is 
component $i \ast (i-1)/2 + j$ of the storage array {\tt H\%val}  
will hold the value $h_{ij}$ (and, by symmetry, $h_{ji}$)
for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$.

\subsubsection{Sparse co-ordinate storage format}\label{coordinate}
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored. For the $l$-th
entry of $\bmJ$, its row index $i$, column index $j$ and value
$j_{ij}$ are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer arrays
{\tt J\%row}, {\tt J\%col} and real array {\tt J\%val}.  The order is
unimportant, but the total number of entries {\tt J\%ne} is also
required.  Since $\bmH$ is symmetric, the same scheme is applicable,
except that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

\subsubsection{Sparse row-wise storage format}\label{rowwise}
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are
ordered so that those in row $i$ appear directly before those in row
$i+1$. For the $i$-th row of $\bmJ$, the $i$-th component of a integer
array {\tt J\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while {\tt J\%ptr} $(m+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices $j$ and values $j_{ij}$ of the entries in the
$i$-th row are stored in components $l =$ {\tt J\%ptr}$(i)$, \ldots
,{\tt J\%ptr} $(i+1)-1$ of the integer array {\tt J\%col}, and real
array {\tt J\%val}, respectively.  Since $\bmH$ is symmetric, the same
scheme is applicable, except that only the entries in the lower
triangle should be stored.

For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than 
its predecessor.

\subsubsection{Sparse column-wise storage format}\label{columnwise}
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time they are
ordered so that those in column $j$ appear directly before those in column
$j+1$. For the $j$-th column of $\bmJ$, the $j$-th component of the integer
array {\tt J\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this column,
while {\tt J\%ptr} $(n+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The row indices $i$ and values $j_{ij}$ of the entries in the
$j$-th column are stored in components $l =$ {\tt J\%ptr}$(j)$, \ldots
,{\tt J\%ptr} $(j+1)-1$ of the integer array {\tt J\%row}, and real
array {\tt J\%val}, respectively.  Since $\bmH$ is symmetric, the same
scheme is applicable, except that only the entries in the lower
triangle should be stored.

\subsubsection{Diagonal storage format}\label{diagonal}
If $\bmJ$ is diagonal (i.e., $j_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \neq j
\leq n$) only the diagonal entries $j_{ii}$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$ should
be stored, and the first $n$ components of the array {\tt J\%val}
should be used for this purpose.  The same holds for $\bmH$.

\galtypes
Seven derived data types are accessible from the package.

%%%%%%%%%%% matrix data type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding matrices}\label{typesmt}
The derived data type {\tt SMT\_TYPE} is used to hold the Jacobian
matrix $\bmJ$ and the Hessian matrix $\bmH$. The components of {\tt
  SMT\_TYPE} used here are:

\begin{description}

\ittf{m} is a scalar component of type \integer\ 
that holds the number of rows of the matrix. 

\ittf{n} is a scalar component of type \integer\ 
that holds the number of columns of the matrix. 
 
\ittf{ne} is a scalar variable of type \integer\ that
holds the number of matrix entries.

\ittf{type} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \character\ that
is used to indicate the matrix storage scheme used. Its precise length and
content depends on the type of matrix to be stored (see \S\ref{typeprob}).

\ittf{val} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \realdp\, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that holds the values of the entries. 
Each pair of off-diagonal entries $h_{ij} = h_{ji}$ for the {\em symmetric}
matrix $\bmH$ is represented as a single entry 
(see \S\ref{dense}--\ref{rowwise}).
Any duplicated entries that appear in the sparse 
co-ordinate, row-wise, or column-wise schemes will be summed. 

\ittf{row} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the row indices of the entries 
(see \S\ref{coordinate}).

\ittf{col} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer, 
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the column indices of the entries
(see \S\ref{coordinate}--\ref{rowwise}).

\ittf{ptr} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer.
If sparse row-wise storage is used (see \S\ref{rowwise}), then it
must have dimension at least {\tt m + 1} and hold the pointers to
the first entry in each row.  If sparse column-wise storage is used (see \S\ref{columnwise}), then it
must have dimension at least {\tt n + 1} and hold the pointers to
the first entry in each column.

string {\tt DENSE}.
For the sparse co-ordinate scheme (see Section~\ref{coordinate}), 
the first ten components of {\tt H\%type} must contain the

into {\tt H\%type}.
For example, if {\tt nlp} is of derived type {\tt \packagename\_problem\_type}
and involves a Hessian we wish to store using the co-ordinate scheme,
we may simply
%\vspace*{-2mm}

value will result in an error message.

\itt{checkG} is a scalar variable of type default \logical\ that

checked.  Otherwise, it should be set \false.  The default is {\tt checkG=\true}.

\itt{checkJ} is a scalar variable of type default \logical\ that
should be set \true\ if the Jacobian of the constraint function should be
checked.  Otherwise, it should be set \false.  The default is {\tt checkJ =\true}.

\itt{checkH} is a scalar variable of type default \logical\ that
should be set \true\ if the Hessian of the Lagrangian function should be
checked.  Otherwise, it should be set \false.  The default is {\tt checkH=\true}.

There are three procedures for user calls
(see Section~\ref{galfeatures} for further features): 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The subroutine 
      {\tt \packagename\_initialize} 
      is used to set default values, and initialize private data, 
      before verifying the derivatives of one or more problems with the
      same sparsity and bound structure.
\item The subroutine 
      {\tt \packagename\_verify} 
      is called to check the derivatives of the given problem.
\item The subroutine 
      {\tt \packagename\_terminate} 
      is provided to allow the user to automatically deallocate array 
       components of the private data, allocated by 
       {\tt \packagename\_verify}, 
       at the end of the verification process. 
       It is important to do this if the data object is re-used for another 
       problem {\bf with a different structure}
       since {\tt \packagename\_initialize} cannot test for this situation, 
       and any existing associated targets will subsequently become unreachable.
\end{enumerate}
We use square brackets {\tt [ ]} to indicate \optional\ arguments.

%%%%%% initialization subroutine %%%%%%

\subsubsection{The initialization subroutine}\label{subinit}
 Default values are provided as follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_initialize( control )}

\vspace*{-3mm}
\begin{description}

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}). 
On exit, {\tt control} contains default values for the components as
described in Section~\ref{typecontrol}.
These values should only be changed after calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.

\end{description}

\subsubsection{The verification  subroutine}
The verification algorithm is called as follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_verify( nlp, data, control, inform, userdata[, eval\_F, 
eval\_C, \hspace{4mm}                  \&}

\ittf{nlp} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type 
{\tt NLPT\_problem\_type}

It is used to hold data about the problem whose derivatives are being verified.
For a new problem, the user must allocate all the array components,
and set values for {\tt nlp\%m}, {\tt nlp\%n},
and the required integer components of {\tt nlp\%J} and {\tt nlp\%H}
that is determined by the values of {\tt checkJ} and {\tt checkH} as described in Section~\ref{typecontrol}.  
Users are free to choose whichever
of the matrix formats described in Section~\ref{galmatrix} 
is appropriate for $\bmJ$ and $\bmH$ for their application.

\noindent
The components {\tt nlp\%X} and {\tt nlp\%Y} must be set to initial
values $\bmx$ and $\bmy$ of the primal and dual variables for the
optimization problem.  Prior to verification of the derivatives, the point {\tt nlp\%X} is modified
internally to ensure feasibility with respect to the bound constraints
$\bmx^l$ and $\bmx^u$; no modification of $\bmy$ is performed.  The
requested derivatives are then checked at the point {\tt nlp\%X} and {\tt nlp\%Y}.

\noindent

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Reverse communication %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\label{reverse}Reverse Communication Information}

A positive value of {\tt inform\%status} on exit from 
{\tt \packagename\_verify}
indicates that
\solver\ is seeking further information---this will happen 
if the user has chosen not to evaluate function or 
derivative values internally (see Sections~\ref{typecontrol} and~\ref{fdv}).
The user should compute the required information and re-enter \solver\
with all arguments (except those specifically mentioned below) unchanged.

Possible values of {\tt inform\%status} and the information required are
\begin{description}

\ittf{2.} The user should compute the objective function
     value $f(\bmx)$ at the point $\bmx$ indicated in {\tt data\%RC\%X}.
     The required value should be set in {\tt data\%RC\%F}.  If the user is
     unable to evaluate $f(\bmx)$---for instance, if the function is
     undefined at $\bmx$---the user need not set {\tt data\%RC\%F}, but
     should then set {\tt inform\%status} to any negative value.
     Otherwise, the value of {\tt inform\%status} should remain unchanged.

\ittf{3.} The user should compute the constraint function
     value $\bmc(\bmx)$ at the point $\bmx$ indicated in {\tt data\%RC\%X}.
     The required value should be set in {\tt data\%RC\%C}.  If the user is
     unable to evaluate $\bmc(\bmx)$---for instance, if the function is
     undefined at $\bmx$---the user need not set {\tt data\%RC\%C}, but
     should then set {\tt inform\%status} to any negative value.
     Otherwise, the value of {\tt inform\%status} should remain unchanged.

\ittf{4.} The user should compute the gradient 
     of the objective function $\nabla_x f(\bmx)$ at the point $\bmx$ 
     indicated in {\tt data\%RC\%X}.
     The value of the $i$-th component of the gradient should be set 
     in {\tt data\%RC\%G(i)} for $i = 1, \ldots, n$.  If the user is
     unable to evaluate a component of $\nabla_x f(\bmx)$---for instance, 
     if a component of the gradient is
     undefined at $\bmx$---the user need not set {\tt data\%RC\%G}, but
     should then set {\tt inform\%status} to a negative
     value. Otherwise, the value of {\tt inform\%status} should remain
     unchanged.

\ittf{5.} The user should compute the Jacobian  
     of the constraint function $\nabla_x \bmc(\bmx)$ at the point $\bmx$ 
     indicated in {\tt data\%RC\%X}. The $l$-th component of the Jacobian stored according to the
     scheme used to input {\tt nlp\%J} (see Section~\ref{typeprob})
     should be set in {\tt data\%RC\%Jval(l)} 
     for $l = 1, \ldots,$ {\tt  nlp\%J\%ne}.  If the user is
     unable to evaluate a component of $\nabla_x \bmc(\bmx)$---for instance, 
     if a component of the Jacobian is
     undefined at $\bmx$---the user need not set {\tt data\%RC\%Jval}, but
     should then set {\tt inform\%status} to a negative number.
     Otherwise, the value of {\tt inform\%status} should remain
     unchanged.

\ittf{6.} The user should compute the value 
     $\bmu + \nabla_x \bmc(\bmx)\bmv$, which requires a product of the Jacobian 
     of the constraint function  $\nabla_x \bmc(\bmx)$ at the
     point $\bmx$ with the vector $\bmv$; the vectors
     $\bmx$, $\bmu$, and $\bmv$ are contained in {\tt
       data\%RC\%X}, {\tt data\%RC\%U}, and {\tt
       data\%RC\%V}, respectively.  On exit, the resulting
     vector $\bmu + \nabla_x \bmc(\bmx)\bmv$ should be stored in
     {\tt data\%RC\%U}.  If the user is
     unable to evaluate the product---for instance, 
     if a component of the Jacobian is
     undefined at $\bmx$---the user need not set {\tt data\%RC\%U}, but
     should then set {\tt inform\%status} to a negative value.
     Otherwise, the value of {\tt inform\%status} should remain
     unchanged.

\ittf{7.} The user should compute the value

     the transpose of the Jacobian 
     of the constraint function $\nabla_x \bmc(\bmx)$ at the
     point $\bmx$ with the vector $\bmv$; the vectors
     $\bmx$, $\bmu$, and $\bmv$ are contained in {\tt

     unable to evaluate the product---for instance, 
     if a component of the Jacobian is
     undefined at $\bmx$---the user need not set {\tt data\%RC\%U}, but
     should then set {\tt inform\%status} to a negative value.
     Otherwise, the value of {\tt inform\%status} should remain
     unchanged.

     indicated in {\tt data\%RC\%X} and {\tt data\%RC\%Y}.
     The $l$-th component of the Hessian stored according to the
     scheme used to input {\tt nlp\%H} (see Section~\ref{typeprob})
     should be set in {\tt data\%RC\%Hval(l)} 
     for $l = 1, \ldots,$ {\tt  nlp\%H\%ne}.  If the user is
     unable to evaluate a component of $\nabla_{xx} L(\bmx,\bmy)$---for instance, 
     if a component of the Hessian is
     undefined at $(\bmx,\bmy)$---the user need not set {\tt data\%RC\%Hval}, but
     should then set {\tt inform\%status} to a negative value.
     Otherwise, the value of {\tt inform\%status} should remain
     unchanged.

\ittf{9.} The user should compute the value 
     $\bmu + \nabla_{xx} L(\bmx,\bmy)\bmv$, which requires a product of the Hessian 
     of the Lagrangian $\nabla_{xx} L(\bmx,\bmy)$ at the
     point $(\bmx,\bmy)$ with the vector $\bmv$; the vectors
     $\bmx$, $\bmy$, $\bmu$, and $\bmv$ are contained in {\tt

     should then set {\tt inform\%status} to a negative value.
     Otherwise, the value of {\tt inform\%status} should remain
     unchanged.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Warning and error messages %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galerrors
A negative value of {\tt inform\%status} on exit from 
{\tt \packagename\_verify}
or 
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}
indicates that an error has occurred. No further calls should be made
until the error has been corrected. Possible values are:

\begin{description}

\itt{\galerrallocate.} An allocation error occurred. 
A message indicating the offending
array is written on unit {\tt control\%error}, and the returned allocation 
status and a string containing the name of the offending array
are held in {\tt inform\%alloc\_\-status}
and {\tt inform\%bad\_alloc}, respectively.

\itt{\galerrdeallocate.} A deallocation error occurred. 
A message indicating the offending 
array is written on unit {\tt control\%error} and the returned allocation 
status and a string containing the name of the offending array
are held in {\tt inform\%alloc\_\-status}
and {\tt inform\%bad\_alloc}, respectively.

\itt{\galerrrestrictions.} 
Either one of the restrictions {\tt nlp\%n} $> 0$ or {\tt nlp\%m}
$\geq 0$ is violated, or the
requirement that {\tt nlp\%J\_type} and {\tt nlp\%H\_type} contain
a relevant string
{\tt 'DENSE'}, {\tt 'COORDINATE'}, {\tt 'SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS'},
{\tt 'SPARSE\_BY\_COLUMNS'}, or {\tt 'DIAGONAL'}
is not satisfied.

\itt{-50.}
The user has called {\tt \packagename\_verify} with {\tt inform\%status}
$< 0$, which indicates that the user was not able to perform a
requested computation needed during reverse communication.

\itt{-51.}
The user has called {\tt \packagename\_verify} with
{\tt inform\%status} $= 0$, which should never happen.  The user
should only set {\tt inform\%status} in two situations: {\tt inform\%status}
$= 1$ prior to the initial call to {\tt \packagename\_verify}, and
{\tt inform\%status} $< 0$ when reverse communication is being used
and the user is unable to perform the required computation as
indicated by the value of {\tt inform\%status} on return from {\tt \packagename\_verify} (see
Section~\ref{reverse}). The user should not
change {\tt inform\%status} for any other reason.

\itt{-55.}
The user has input an invalid value for at least one of the control
parameters
{\tt f\_availability}, {\tt c\_availability}, {\tt g\_availability},
{\tt J\_availability}, or {\tt H\_availability} as described in
Section~\ref{typecontrol}.

\itt{-56.}
Based on the values of the control parameters
{\tt f\_availability}, {\tt c\_availability}, {\tt g\_availability},
{\tt J\_availa\-bility}, and {\tt H\_availability} (see Section~\ref{typecontrol}), at least one 
optional dummy subroutine is missing in the call to {\tt \packagename\_verify}.

\itt{-57.}
At least one component of {\tt nlp\%X\_l} or {\tt nlp\%X\_u} is
inappropriate (see Section~\ref{typeprob}).

\itt{-58.}
A user supplied function (see Sections~\ref{ffv}--\ref{hvfv}) returned {\tt inform\%status} $\neq 0$,
implying that the function computation could not be performed at the required point. 

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Further features %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galfeatures
\noindent In this section, we describe an alternative means of setting 
control parameters---that is components of the variable {\tt control} of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol})---by reading an appropriate data specification file using the
subroutine {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}. This facility
is useful as it allows a user to change  {\tt \packagename} control parameters 
without editing and recompiling programs that call {\tt \packagename}.

A specification file, or specfile, is a data file containing a number of 
"specification commands". Each command occurs on a separate line, 
and comprises a "keyword", 
which is a string (in a close-to-natural language) used to identify a 
control parameter, and 
an (optional) "value", which defines the value to be assigned to the given
control parameter. All keywords and values are case insensitive, 
keywords may be preceded by one or more blanks but
values must not contain blanks, and
each value must be separated from its keyword by at least one blank.
Values must not contain more than 30 characters, and 
each line of the specfile is limited to 80 characters,
including the blanks separating keyword and value.

The portion of the specification file used by 
{\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
must start
with a "{\tt BEGIN \packagename}" command and end with an 
"{\tt END}" command.  The syntax of the specfile is thus defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  ( .. lines ignored by CHECK_read_specfile .. )
    BEGIN CHECK
       keyword    value
       .......    .....
       keyword    value
    END 
  ( .. lines ignored by CHECK_read_specfile .. )
\end{verbatim}
where keyword and value are two strings separated by (at least) one blank.
The ``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiter command lines 
may contain additional (trailing) strings so long as such strings are 
separated by one or more blanks, so that lines such as
\begin{verbatim}
    BEGIN CHECK SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
    END CHECK SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
are acceptable. Furthermore, 
between the
``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiters,
specification commands may occur in any order.  Blank lines and
lines whose first non-blank character is {\tt !} or {\tt *} are ignored. 
The content 
of a line after a {\tt !} or {\tt *} character is also 
ignored (as is the {\tt !} or {\tt *}
character itself). This provides an easy manner to "comment out" some 
specification commands, or to comment specific values 
of certain control parameters.  

The value of a control parameters may be of three different types, namely
integer, logical, or real.
Integer and real values may be expressed in any relevant Fortran integer and
floating-point formats (respectively). Permitted values for logical
parameters are "{\tt ON}", "{\tt TRUE}", "{\tt .TRUE.}", "{\tt T}", 
"{\tt YES}", "{\tt Y}", or "{\tt OFF}", "{\tt NO}",
"{\tt N}", "{\tt FALSE}", "{\tt .FALSE.}" and "{\tt F}". 
Empty values are also allowed for 
logical control parameters, and are interpreted as "{\tt TRUE}".  

The specification file must be open for 
input when {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
is called, and the associated device number 
passed to the routine in device (see below). 
Note that the corresponding 
file is {\tt REWIND}ed, which makes it possible to combine the specifications 
for more than one program/routine.  For the same reason, the file is not
closed by {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}.

\subsubsection{To read control parameters from a specification file}
\label{readspec}

Control parameters may be read from a file as follows:
\hskip0.5in 
\def\baselinestretch{0.8} {\tt \begin{verbatim}
     CALL CHECK_read_specfile( control, device ) \end{verbatim}
}
\def\baselinestretch{1.0}

\begin{description}
\itt{control} is a scalar \intentinout argument of type 
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}). 
Default values should have already been set, perhaps by calling 
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, individual components of {\tt control} may have been changed
according to the commands found in the specfile. Specfile commands and 
the components (see Section~\ref{typecontrol}) of {\tt control} 
that they affect are given in Table~\ref{specfile}.

\bctable{|l|l|l|} 
\hline
  command & component of {\tt control} & value type \\ 
\hline
  {\tt error-printout-device} & {\tt \%error} & integer \\
  {\tt printout-device} & {\tt \%out} & integer \\
  {\tt print-level} & {\tt \%print\_level} & integer \\

  {\tt H-availability} & {\tt \%H\_availability} & integer \\

  {\tt deallocate-error-fatal}   & {\tt \%deallocate\_error\_fatal} & logical \\
\hline

\ectable{\label{specfile}Specfile commands and associated 
components of {\tt control}.}

\itt{device} is a scalar \intentin argument of type \integer,
that must be set to the unit number on which the specfile
has been opened. If {\tt device} is not open, {\tt control} will
not be altered and execution will continue, but an error message
will be printed on unit {\tt control\%error}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Information printed %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galinfo
If {\tt control\%print\_level} is positive, information about the
derivative verification will be printed on unit {\tt control\-\%out},
provided {\tt control\%out} $> 0$.
If {\tt control\%print\_level} $= 1$, a basic summary of the
derivative checking is produced.  If {\tt control\%print\_level} $=
2$, then in addition to the above there is detailed output of the
derivative verification, control parameters are printed, and basic
matrix data is produced.  If {\tt control\%print\_level} $=
3$, then in addition to the above, full matrix data is printed.
Finally, {\tt control\%print\_level} $\geq 4$ is used for debugging
and in addition to the above also prints private data used during the
verification process.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% METHOD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmethod
Finite difference approximations are used to numerically ``verify'' requested
derivatives.  If {\tt verify\_level} $=1$, we perform a
``cheap'' check of the gradient of the objective function by
comparing $(f(\bmx) - f(\bmx+\alpha \bms))/\alpha$ with $\nabla_x f(\bmx)^T\bms$
for some appropriately chosen vector $\bms$ and scalar $0 < \alpha \ll
1$.  Similarly, for the Jacobian of the constraints and the Hessian of
the Lagrangian, we compare $(\bmc(\bmx) - \bmc(\bmx+\alpha
\bms))/\alpha$ to $\nabla_x \bmc(\bmx)\bms$ and $(\nabla_xL(\bmx,\bmy)
- \nabla_xL(\bmx+\alpha\bms,\bmy))/\alpha$ to $\nabla_{xx}
L(\bmx,\bmy)\bms$, respectively.  If {\tt verify\_level} $=2$, we perform an
``expensive'' verification of the gradient of the objective function by
comparing $(f(\bmx) - f(\bmx+\alpha\bme_i))/\alpha$ with $[\nabla_x
f(\bmx)]_i$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$, where $\bme_i$ is the $i$th
coordinate vector.  Similarly, for the Jacobian of the constraints and the Hessian of
the Lagrangian, we compare $[(\bmc(\bmx) - \bmc(\bmx+\alpha
\bme_j))]_i/\alpha$ to $[\nabla_x \bmc(\bmx)]_{ij}$ and $[(\nabla_xL(\bmx,\bmy)
- \nabla_xL(\bmx+\alpha\bme_j,\bmy))]_i/\alpha$ to $[\nabla_{xx}
L(\bmx,\bmy)]_{ij}$, respectively.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galexamples
Suppose we wish to perform an ``expensive'' check of the derivatives associated with the objective function
$f(\bmx) = x_1 + x_2^3/3$ and the constraint function
$\bmc(\bmx) = (x_1 + x_2^2 + x_3^3 + x_3x_2^2, -x_2^4)$ at the point
$\bmx = (4,3,2)$ and $\bmy = (2,3)$, with bounds $\bmx^l = (-5,-5,-5)$ and
$\bmx^u = (5,5,5)$.
