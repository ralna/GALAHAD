%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary
Given a {\bf block, symmetric matrix}
\disp{ \bmK_{H} = \mat{cc}{ \bmH & \bmA^T \\ \bmA  & - \bmC },}
this package constructs a variety of {\bf preconditioners} of the form
\eqn{prec1}{ \bmK_{G} = \mat{cc}{ \bmG & \bmA^T \\ \bmA  & - \bmC }.}
Here, the leading-block matrix $\bmG$ is a suitably-chosen
approximation to $\bmH$; it may either be prescribed {\bf explicitly}, in
which case a symmetric indefinite factorization of $\bmK_{G}$
will be formed using the \galahad\ package {\tt SLS},
or {\bf implicitly}, by requiring certain sub-blocks of $\bmG$
be zero. In the latter case, a factorization of $\bmK_{G}$ will be
obtained implicitly (and more efficiently) without recourse to {\tt SLS}.
In particular, for implicit preconditioners, a reordering
\eqn{prec2}{ \bmK_{G} = \bmP
\mat{ccc}{ \bmG_{11}^{} & \bmG_{21}^T & \bmA_1^T \\
\bmG_{21}^{} & \bmG_{22}^{} & \bmA_2^T \\
\bmA_{1}^{} & \bmA_{2}^{} & - \bmC} \bmP^T}
involving a suitable permutation $\bmP$ will be found, for some
invertible sub-block (``basis'') $\bmA_1$ of the columns of $\bmA$;
the selection and factorization of $\bmA_1$ uses
the \galahad\ package {\tt ULS}.
Once the preconditioner has been constructed,
solutions to the preconditioning system
\eqn{ls}{ \mat{cc}{ \bmG & \bmA^T \\ \bmA  & - \bmC } \vect{ \bmx \\ \bmy }
 = \vect{\bma \\ \bmb}}
may be obtained by the package.
Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the matrices $\bmH$,
$\bmA$ and $\bmC$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% matrix formats %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmatrix
Each of the input matrices $\bmH$, $\bmA$ and $\bmC$
may be stored in a variety of input formats.

\subsubsection{Dense storage format}\label{dense}
The matrix $\bmA$ is stored as a compact
dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
Component $n \ast (i-1) + j$ of the storage array {\tt A\%val} will hold the
value $a_{ij}$ for $i = 1, \ldots , m$, $j = 1, \ldots , n$.
Since $\bmH$ and $\bmC$ are symmetric, only the lower triangular parts
(that is the part $h_{ij}$ for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$ and
$c_{ij}$ for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq m$) need be held. In these cases
the lower triangle will be stored by rows, that is
component $i \ast (i-1)/2 + j$ of the storage array {\tt H\%val}
will hold the value $h_{ij}$ (and, by symmetry, $h_{ji}$)
for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$. Similarly
component $i \ast (i-1)/2 + j$ of the storage array {\tt C\%val}
will hold the value $c_{ij}$ (and, by symmetry, $c_{ji}$)
for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq m$.

\subsubsection{Sparse co-ordinate storage format}\label{coordinate}
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored. For the
$l$-th entry of $\bmA$, its row index $i$, column index $j$
and value $a_{ij}$
are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer arrays {\tt A\%row},
{\tt A\%col} and real array {\tt A\%val}, respectively.
The order is unimportant, but the total
number of entries {\tt A\%ne} is also required.
The same scheme is applicable to $\bmH$ and $\bmC$
(thus, for $\bmH$, requiring integer arrays {\tt H\%row}, {\tt H\%col}, a real
array  {\tt H\%val} and an integer value {\tt H\%ne}),
except that only the entries in the lower triangle need be stored.

\subsubsection{Sparse row-wise storage format}\label{rowwise}
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in row $i$ appear directly before those
in row $i+1$. For the $i$-th row of $\bmA$, the $i$-th component of a
integer array {\tt A\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while {\tt A\%ptr} $(m+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices $j$ and values $a_{ij}$ of the entries in the $i$-th row
are stored in components
$l =$ {\tt A\%ptr}$(i)$, \ldots ,{\tt A\%ptr} $(i+1)-1$ of the
integer array {\tt A\%col}, and real array {\tt A\%val}, respectively.
The same scheme is applicable to
$\bmH$ and $\bmC$ (thus, for $\bmH$,
requiring integer arrays {\tt H\%ptr}, {\tt H\%col}, and
a real array {\tt H\%val}),
except that only the entries in the lower triangle need be stored.

For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
its predecessor.

\subsubsection{Diagonal storage format}\label{diagonal}
If $\bmH$ is diagonal (i.e., $h_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \neq j \leq n$)
only the diagonals entries $h_{ii}$, $1 \leq i \leq n$,  need be stored,
and the first $n$ components of the array {\tt H\%val} may be used for
the purpose. The same applies to $\bmC$, but
there is no sensible equivalent for the non-square $\bmA$.

\subsubsection{Scaled-identity storage format}\label{scaled}
If $\bmH$ is a scalar multiple $h$ of the identity matrix, $h \bmI$,
only the value $h$ needs be stored,
and the first component of the array {\tt H\%val}
 may be used for
the purpose. The same applies to $\bmC$, but
as before there is no sensible equivalent for the non-square $\bmA$.

\subsubsection{Identity storage format}\label{identity}
If $\bmH$ is the identity matrix, $\bmI$,
no numerical data need be stored. The same applies to $\bmC$, but
once again there is no sensible equivalent for the non-square $\bmA$.

\subsubsection{Zero storage format}\label{zero}
Finally, if $\bmH$ is the zero matrix, $\bmzero$,
no numerical data need be stored. The same applies to both $\bmA$ and $\bmC$.

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding matrices}\label{typesmt}
The derived data type {\tt SMT\_TYPE} is used to hold the matrices $\bmH$,
$\bmA$ and $\bmC$. The components of {\tt SMT\_TYPE} used here are:

\begin{description}

\ittf{m} is a scalar component of type \integer,
that holds the number of rows in the matrix.

\ittf{n} is a scalar component of type \integer,
that holds the number of columns in the matrix.

\ittf{type} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \character, that
is used to indicate the storage scheme used. If the dense storage scheme
(see \S\ref{dense}), is used,
the first five components of {\tt type} must contain the
string {\tt DENSE}.
For the sparse co-ordinate scheme (see \S\ref{coordinate}),
the first ten components of {\tt type} must contain the
string {\tt COORDINATE},
for the sparse row-wise storage scheme (see \S\ref{rowwise}),
the first fourteen components of {\tt type} must contain the
string {\tt SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS},
for the diagonal storage scheme (see \S\ref{diagonal}),
the first eight components of {\tt type} must contain the
string {\tt DIAGONAL}.
for the scaled-identity storage scheme (see \S\ref{scaled}),
the first fifteen components of {\tt type} must contain the
string {\tt SCALED\_IDENTITY}.
and for the identity storage scheme (see \S\ref{identity}),
the first eight components of {\tt type} must contain the
string {\tt IDENTITY}.
It is also permissible to set
the first four components of {\tt type} to the either of the strings
{\tt ZERO} or {\tt NONE}
in the case of matrix $\bmC$ to indicate that $\bmC = 0$.

For convenience, the procedure {\tt SMT\_put}
may be used to allocate sufficient space and insert the required keyword
into {\tt type}.
For example, if {\tt H} is of derived type {\tt SMT\_type}
and we wish to use the co-ordinate storage scheme, we may simply
%\vspace*{-2mm}
{\tt
\begin{verbatim}
        CALL SMT_put( H%type, 'COORDINATE', istat )
\end{verbatim}
}
%\vspace*{-4mm}
\noindent
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SMT}
for further details on the use of {\tt SMT\_put}.

\ittf{ne} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that
holds the number of matrix entries.

\ittf{val} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \realdp\,
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that holds the values of the entries.
Each pair of off-diagonal entries $h_{ij} = h_{ji}$ of a {\em symmetric}
matrix $\bmH$ is represented as a single entry
(see \S\ref{dense}--\ref{rowwise}); the same applies to $\bmC$.
Any duplicated entries that appear in the sparse
co-ordinate or row-wise schemes will be summed.
If the matrix is stored using the diagonal scheme (see \S\ref{diagonal}),
{\tt val} should be of length {\tt n}, and the value of the {\tt i}-th
diagonal stored in {\tt val(i)}.
If the matrix is stored using the scaled-identity scheme (see \S\ref{identity}),
{\tt val(1)} should be set to $h$.

\ittf{row} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer,
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the row indices of the entries.
(see \S\ref{coordinate}).

\ittf{col} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer,
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the column indices of the entries
(see \S\ref{coordinate}--\ref{rowwise}).

\ittf{ptr} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer,
and dimension at least {\tt m + 1}, that may hold the pointers to
the first entry in each row (see \S\ref{rowwise}).

%%%%%%%%%%% control type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding control
 parameters}\label{typecontrol}

The default is {\tt out = 6}.

\itt{print\_level} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that is used
to control the amount of informational output which is required. No
informational output will occur if {\tt print\_level} $\leq 0$. If
{\tt print\_level} $= 1$, a single line of output will be produced for each
iteration of the process. If {\tt print\_level} $\geq 2$, this output will be
increased to provide significant detail of each iteration.
The default is {\tt print\_level = 0}.

to indicate how $\bmH$ has changed (if at all) since the previous call
to {\tt SBLS\_form\_and\_factorize}. Possible values are:

\end{description}
The default is {\tt new\_c = 2}.

\itt{preconditioner} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that specifies which preconditioner to be used;
positive values correspond to explicit-factorization preconditioners
while negative values indicate implicit-factorization ones. Possible values are:

        user.
\itt{11} $\bmG$ is chosen so that $\bmG_{11} = 0$, $\bmG_{21} = 0$
        and $\bmG_{22} = \bmH_{22}$.
\itt{12} $\bmG$ is chosen so that $\bmG_{11} = 0$, $\bmG_{21} = \bmH_{21}$
        and $\bmG_{22} = \bmH_{22}$.
\itt{-1} for the special case when $\bmC = 0$,
        $\bmG$ is chosen so that $\bmG_{11} = 0$, $\bmG_{21} = 0$,
        $\bmG_{22}$ is the identity matrix, and the preconditioner is computed
        implicitly.
\itt{-2} for the special case when $\bmC = 0$,
        $\bmG$ is chosen so that $\bmG_{11} = 0$, $\bmG_{21} = 0$,
        $\bmG_{22} = \bmH_{22}$ and the preconditioner is computed

specifies which factorization of the preconditioner should be used.
Possible values are:

\begin{description}

        factorization, involving factors of $\bmG$ and $\bmA \bmG^{-1} \bmA^T$,
        will be used. Otherwise an augmented-system factorization, involving
        factors of $\bmK_G$, will be used.
\itt{2} an augmented-system factorization, involving factors of $\bmK_G$,
        will be used.
\itt{3} a null-space factorization (see \S\ref{galmethod}) will be used
provided that $\bmC = \bmzero$.

of the preconditioner.
The default is {\tt itref\_max = 1}.

%\itt{scaling} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that is used

%\itt{ordering} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that is used

%\itt{pivot\_tol}  is a scalar variable of type default
%\realdp, that holds the
%threshold pivot tolerance used by the matrix factorization.  See
%the documentation for the packages {\tt SILS} and {\tt ULS} for details.
%The default is {\tt pivot\_tol = 0.01}.

\itt{pivot\_tol\_for\_basis} is a scalar variable of type default
\realdp, that holds the relative
pivot tolerance used by the package {\tt ULS}
when computing the non-singular basis matrix $\bmA_1$ for
an implicit-factorization preconditioner. Since the calculation of a
suitable basis is crucial, it is sensible to pick a larger
value of {\tt pivot\_tol\_for\_basis} than
the default value {\tt relative\_pivot\_tolerance} provided by {\tt ULS}.
The default is {\tt pivot\_tol\_for\_basis = 0.5}.

%\itt{zero\_pivot} is a scalar variable of type \realdp,
%that is used to detect singularity. Any pivot encountered during the
%factorization whose absolute value is less than or equal to  {\tt zero\_pivot}
%will be regarded as zero, and the matrix as singular.

should be removed and \false\ otherwise.
The default is {\tt remove\_dependencies = .TRUE.}.

\itt{check\_basis} is a scalar variable of type default \logical,
that must be set \true\ if the basis matrix $\bmA_{1}^{}$ constructed
when using an implicit-factorization preconditioner or null-space factorization
should be assessed for ill conditioning and corrected if necessary. If these

set \false. The default is {\tt check\_basis = .TRUE.}.

\itt{find\_basis\_by\_transpose} is a scalar variable of type default \logical,
that must be set \true\ if the invertible sub-block $\bmA_1$ of the
columns of $\bmA$ is computed by analysing the transpose of $\bmA$
and \false\ if the analysis is based on $\bmA$ itself. Generally
an analysis based on the transpose is faster.
The default is {\tt find\_basis\_by\_transpose = .TRUE.}.

\itt{affine} is a scalar variable of type default \logical,
that must be set \true\ if the component $\bmb$ of the right-hand side
of the required system \req{ls} is zero, and \false\ otherwise.

the value of the norm of the residuals for the computed solution
when applying the preconditioner and  \false\ otherwise.
The default is {\tt get\_norm\_residual = .FALSE.}.

\itt{space\_critical} is a scalar variable of type default \logical,
that must be set \true\ if space is critical when allocating arrays
and  \false\ otherwise. The package may run faster if
{\tt space\_critical} is \false\ but at the possible expense of a larger
storage requirement. The default is {\tt space\_critical = .FALSE.}.

\itt{deallocate\_error\_fatal} is a scalar variable of type default \logical,
that must be set \true\ if the user wishes to terminate execution if
a deallocation  fails, and \false\ if an attempt to continue
will be made. The default is {\tt deallocate\_error\_fatal = .FALSE.}.

\itt{symmetric\_linear\_solver} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 30, that specifies the external package to be used to

{\tt 'ma77'},
{\tt 'ma86'},
{\tt 'ma97'},

{\tt 'ma97'},

although only {\tt 'sils'},  {\tt 'potr'}, {\tt 'pbtr'}
and, for OMP 4.0-compliant compilers,
{\tt 'ssids'} are installed by default.
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SLS} for further details.
The default is {\tt definite\_linear\_solver = 'sils'}.

\itt{unsymmetric\_linear\_solver} is a scalar variable of type default
\character\
and length 30, that specifies the external package to be used to
solve any unsymmetric linear systems that might arise. Possible
choices are
{\tt 'gls'},

and
{\tt 'ma48'},
although only {\tt 'gls'} is installed by default.
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt ULS} for further details.
The default is {\tt unsymmetric\_linear\_solver = 'gls'}.

\itt{prefix} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 30, that may be used to provide a user-selected
character string to preface every line of printed output.
Specifically, each line of output will be prefaced by the string
{\tt prefix(2:LEN(TRIM(prefix))-1)},
thus ignoring the first and last non-null components of the
supplied string. If the user does not want to preface lines by such
a string, they may use the default {\tt prefix = ""}.

{\tt SLS\_control\_type} that is used to pass control

linear systems that might arise.
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SLS} for further details.
In particular, default values are as for {\tt SLS}.

\itt{ULS\_control} is a scalar variable argument of type
{\tt ULS\_control\_type} that is used to pass control
options to external packages used to solve any unsymmetric
linear systems that might arise.
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt ULS} for further details.

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding informational
 parameters}\label{typeinform}
The derived data type
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
is used to hold parameters that give information about the progress and needs
of the algorithm. The components of
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
are:

\begin{description}

\itt{status} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that gives the
exit status of the algorithm.
%See Sections~\ref{galerrors} and \ref{galinfo}
See \S\ref{galerrors}
for details.

\itt{alloc\_status} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that gives
the status of the last attempted array allocation or deallocation.
This will be 0 if {\tt status = 0}.

\itt{bad\_alloc} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 80, that  gives the name of the last internal array
for which there were allocation or deallocation errors.
This will be the null string if {\tt status = 0}.

%\itt{sls\_analyse\_status} is a scalar variable of type \integer
%that reports the return code from the most recent call to {\tt SLS\_analyse}
%by {\tt \packagename\_form\_and\_factorize}. A non-zero value indicates
%a warning or an error. See the documentation for the package {\tt SLS}
%for further details.

%\itt{sls\_factorize\_status} is a scalar variable of type \integer
%that reports the return code from the most recent call to {\tt SLS\_factorize}

that indicates the preconditioner method used. The range of values returned
corresponds to those requested in {\tt control\%preconditioner},
excepting that the requested value may have been altered to a more
appropriate one during the factorization. In particular, if the automatic
choice {\tt control\%preconditioner = 0} is requested,
{\tt preconditioner} reports the actual choice made.

$\bmA$ is rank defficient, and \false\ otherwise

\itt{perturbed} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that has the
value \true\ if and only if the original choice of $\bmG$ has been perturbed to
ensure that $\bmK_G$ is an appropriate preconditioner. This will only
happen if {\tt control\-\%perturb\_to\_make\_definite} has been set \true.

that holds the infinity norm of the residual of the system \req{ls}
after a call to {\tt \packagename\_solve} if {\tt control\%get\_norm\_residual}
has been set \true. Otherwise it will have the value -1.0.

%%%%%%%%%%% data type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding problem data}\label{typedata}
The derived data types
{\tt \packagename\_explicit\_factor\_type},
{\tt \packagename\_implicit\_factor\_type} and
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
are used to hold all the data for the problem and the factors of
its preconditioners between calls of
{\tt \packagename} procedures.
This data should be preserved, untouched, from the initial call to
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
to the final call to
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% argument lists %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galarguments
There are four procedures for user calls
(see \S\ref{galfeatures} for further features):

\begin{enumerate}
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_initialize}
      is used to set default values, and initialize private data,
      before solving one or more problems with the
      same sparsity and bound structure.
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_form\_and\_factorize}
      is called to form and factorize the preconditioner.
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_solve}
      is called to apply the preconditioner, that is to solve a linear
      system of the form \req{ls}.
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_terminate}
      is provided to allow the user to automatically deallocate array
       components of the private data, allocated by
       {\tt \packagename\_form\_and\_factorize}
       at the end of the solution process.
\end{enumerate}
We use square brackets {\tt [ ]} to indicate \optional arguments.

These values should only be changed after calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.

\itt{inform} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Further features %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galfeatures
\noindent In this section, we describe an alternative means of setting
control parameters, that is components of the variable {\tt control} of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see \S\ref{typecontrol}),
by reading an appropriate data specification file using the
subroutine {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}. This facility
is useful as it allows a user to change  {\tt \packagename} control parameters
without editing and recompiling programs that call {\tt \packagename}.

A specification file, or specfile, is a data file containing a number of
"specification commands". Each command occurs on a separate line,
and comprises a "keyword",
which is a string (in a close-to-natural language) used to identify a
control parameter, and
an (optional) "value", which defines the value to be assigned to the given
control parameter. All keywords and values are case insensitive,
keywords may be preceded by one or more blanks but
values must not contain blanks, and
each value must be separated from its keyword by at least one blank.
Values must not contain more than 30 characters, and
each line of the specfile is limited to 80 characters,
including the blanks separating keyword and value.



The portion of the specification file used by
{\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
must start
with a "{\tt BEGIN \packagename}" command and end with an
"{\tt END}" command.  The syntax of the specfile is thus defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  ( .. lines ignored by SBLS_read_specfile .. )
    BEGIN SBLS
       keyword    value
       .......    .....
       keyword    value
    END
  ( .. lines ignored by SBLS_read_specfile .. )
\end{verbatim}
where keyword and value are two strings separated by (at least) one blank.
The ``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiter command lines
may contain additional (trailing) strings so long as such strings are
separated by one or more blanks, so that lines such as
\begin{verbatim}
    BEGIN SBLS SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
    END SBLS SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
are acceptable. Furthermore,
between the
``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiters,
specification commands may occur in any order.  Blank lines and
lines whose first non-blank character is {\tt !} or {\tt *} are ignored.
The content
of a line after a {\tt !} or {\tt *} character is also
ignored (as is the {\tt !} or {\tt *}
character itself). This provides an easy manner to "comment out" some
specification commands, or to comment specific values
of certain control parameters.

The value of a control parameters may be of three different types, namely
integer, logical or real.
Integer and real values may be expressed in any relevant Fortran integer and
floating-point formats (respectively). Permitted values for logical
parameters are "{\tt ON}", "{\tt TRUE}", "{\tt .TRUE.}", "{\tt T}",
"{\tt YES}", "{\tt Y}", or "{\tt OFF}", "{\tt NO}",
"{\tt N}", "{\tt FALSE}", "{\tt .FALSE.}" and "{\tt F}".
Empty values are also allowed for
logical control parameters, and are interpreted as "{\tt TRUE}".

The specification file must be open for
input when {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
is called, and the associated device number
passed to the routine in device (see below).
Note that the corresponding
file is {\tt REWIND}ed, which makes it possible to combine the specifications
for more than one program/routine.  For the same reason, the file is not
closed by {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}.

Control parameters corresponding to the components
{\tt SLS\_control}
and
{\tt ULS\_control} may be changed by including additional sections enclosed by
``{\tt BEGIN SLS}'' and
``{\tt END SLS}'', and
``{\tt BEGIN ULS}'' and
``{\tt END ULS}'', respectively.
See the specification sheets for the packages
{\tt \libraryname\_SLS}
and
{\tt \libraryname\_ULS}
for further details.

\subsubsection{To read control parameters from a specification file}
\label{readspec}

Control parameters may be read from a file as follows:

\begin{description}
\itt{control} is a scalar \intentinout argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see \S\ref{typecontrol}).
Default values should have already been set, perhaps by calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, individual components of {\tt control} may have been changed
according to the commands found in the specfile. Specfile commands and
the component (see \S\ref{typecontrol}) of {\tt control}
that each affects are given in Table~\ref{specfile}.

factorization is required. In the explicit case, the
package is really little more than a wrapper for the
symmetric, indefinite linear solver {\tt SLS} in
which the system matrix $\bmK_G$ is assembled from its constituents
$\bmA$, $\bmC$ and whichever $\bmG$ is requested by the user.
Implicit-factorization preconditioners are more involved,
and there is a large variety of different possibilities. The
essential ideas are described in detail in

The range-space factorization is based upon the decomposition
\disp{ \bmK_{G} =
\mat{cc}{ \bmG & \bmzero \\ \bmA & \bmI}
\mat{cc}{ \bmG^{-1} & \bmzero \\ \bmzero & - \bmS}
\mat{cc}{ \bmG & \bmA^T \\ \bmzero & \bmI},}
where the ``Schur complement'' $\bmS = \bmC + \bmA \bmG^{-1} \bmA^T$.
Such a method requires that $\bmS$ is easily invertible. This is often the
case when $\bmG$ is a diagonal matrix, in which case $\bmS$ is frequently
sparse, or when $m \ll n$ in which case $\bmS$
is small and a dense Cholesky factorization may be used.
\vspace*{1mm}

\noindent
When $\bmC = 0$, the null-space factorization is based upon the decomposition
\disp{ \bmK_{G} = \bmP
\mat{ccc}{
\bmG_{11}^{} & \bmzero & \bmI \\
\bmG_{21}^{} & \bmI & \bmA_{2}^{T} \bmA_{1}^{-T}  \\
\bmA_{1}^{} & \bmzero & \bmzero }
\mat{ccc}{\bmzero & \bmzero & \bmI \\
\;\;\; \bmzero \;\; & \;\; \bmR \;\; & \bmzero \\
\bmI & \bmzero & - \bmG_{11}^{}}
\mat{ccc}{
\bmG_{11}^{} & \bmG_{21}^T & \bmA_{1}^T \\
\bmzero & \bmI & \bmzero \\
\bmI & \bmA_{1}^{-1} \bmA_{2}^{} & \bmzero}
\bmP^T,}
where the ``reduced Hessian''
\disp{\bmR =
( - \bmA_{2}^{T} \bmA_1^{-T} \;\; \bmI )
\mat{cc}{\bmG_{11}^{} & \bmG_{21}^{T} \\ \bmG_{21}^{} & \bmG_{22}^{}}
\vect{ - \bmA_1^{-1} \bmA_2^{} \\ \bmI}}
and $\bmP$ is a suitably-chosen permutation for which $\bmA_1$ is invertible.
The method is most useful when $m \approx n$ as then the dimension
of $\bmR$ is small and a dense Cholesky factorization may be used.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galexample
Suppose we wish to solve the linear system \req{ls} with matrix data
\disp{\bmH = \mat{ccc}{1 & & 4 \\ & 2 & \\ 4 &  & 3}, \;\;
 \bmA = \mat{ccc}{ 2 & 1 & \\ & 1 & 1}
\tim{and}  \bmC = \mat{cc}{  & 1 \\ 1 &   }}
and right-hand sides
\disp{\bma = \vect{7 \\ 4 \\ 8} \tim{and} \bmb = \vect{2 \\ 1}.}
Then storing the matrices in sparse co-ordinate format,
we may use the following code:

{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageexample}
}
\noindent
This produces the following output:
{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageresults}
}
\noindent
The same problem may be solved holding the data in
a sparse row-wise storage format by replacing the lines
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
!  sparse co-ordinate storage format
...
! problem data complete
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
by
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
! sparse row-wise storage format
   CALL SMT_put( H%type, 'SPARSE_BY_ROWS', s )  ! Specify sparse-by-rows
   CALL SMT_put( A%type, 'SPARSE_BY_ROWS', s )  ! storage for H, A and C
   CALL SMT_put( C%type, 'SPARSE_BY_ROWS', s )
   ALLOCATE( H%val( h_ne ), H%col( h_ne ), H%ptr( n + 1 ) )
   ALLOCATE( A%val( a_ne ), A%col( a_ne ), A%ptr( m + 1 ) )
   ALLOCATE( C%val( c_ne ), C%col( c_ne ), C%ptr( m + 1 ) )
   H%val = (/ 1.0_wp, 2.0_wp, 3.0_wp, 4.0_wp /) ! matrix H
   H%col = (/ 1, 2, 3, 1 /)                     ! NB lower triangular
   H%ptr = (/ 1, 2, 3, 5 /)                     ! Set row pointers
   A%val = (/ 2.0_wp, 1.0_wp, 1.0_wp, 1.0_wp /) ! matrix A
   A%col = (/ 1, 2, 2, 3 /)
   A%ptr = (/ 1, 3, 5 /)                        ! Set row pointers
   C%val = (/ 1.0_wp /)                         ! matrix C
   C%col = (/ 1 /)                              ! NB lower triangular
   C%ptr = (/ 1, 1, 2 /)                        ! Set row pointers
! problem data complete
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
or using a dense storage format with the replacement lines
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
! dense storage format
   CALL SMT_put( H%type, 'DENSE', s )  ! Specify dense
   CALL SMT_put( A%type, 'DENSE', s )  ! storage for H, A and C
   CALL SMT_put( C%type, 'DENSE', s )
   ALLOCATE( H%val( n * ( n + 1 ) / 2 ) )
   ALLOCATE( A%val( n * m ) )
   ALLOCATE( C%val( m * ( m + 1 ) / 2 ) )
   H%val = (/ 1.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 2.0_wp, 4.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 3.0_wp /) ! H
   A%val = (/ 2.0_wp, 1.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 1.0_wp, 1.0_wp /) ! A
   C%val = (/ 0.0_wp, 1.0_wp, 0.0_wp /)                         ! C
! problem data complete
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
respectively.

If instead $\bmH$ had been the diagonal matrix
\disp{\bmH = \mat{ccc}{1 & &   \\ & 0 & \\  &  & 3}}
but the other data is as before, the diagonal storage scheme
might be used for $\bmH$, and in this case we would instead
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
   CALL SMT_put( prob%H%type, 'DIAGONAL', s )  ! Specify dense storage for H
   ALLOCATE( p%H%val( n ) )
   p%H%val = (/ 1.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 3.0_wp /) ! Hessian values
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
Notice here that zero diagonal entries are stored.
