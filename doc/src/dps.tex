%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary
Given a real $n$ by $n$ symmetric matrix $\bmH$, this package {\bf construct a
symmetric, positive definite matrix $\bmM$ so that $\bmH$
is diagonal in the norm $\|\bmv\|_{\bmM} = \sqrt{\bmv^T \bmM \bmv}$
induced by $\bmM$}. Subsequently the package can be use to
{\bf solve the trust-region subproblem}
\eqn{trs}{\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(\bmx) = \half \bmx^T \bmH \bmx + \bmc^T \bmx
  + f \;\; \mbox{subject to}\;\; \|\bmx\||_{\bmM} \leq \Delta}
or the {\bf regularized quadratic problem}
\eqn{rqs}{\mbox{minimize}\;\; q(\bmx) + \sfrac{1}{p} \sigma
  \|\bmx\||_{\bmM}^p}
for a real $n$ vector $\bmc$ and scalars $f$, $\Delta>0$, $\sigma>0$
and $p \geq 2$.

\noindent
A factorization of the matrix $\bmH$ will be required, so this package is
most suited for the case where such a factorization, either dense or sparse,
may be found efficiently.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO USE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galhowto

The package is available using both single and double precision reals, 
and either 32-bit or 64-bit integers. Access to the 32-bit integer,
single precision version requires the {\tt USE} statement
\medskip

\hspace{8mm} {\tt USE \fullpackagename\_single}

\medskip
\noindent
with the obvious substitution {\tt \fullpackagename\_double},
{\tt \fullpackagename\_single\_64} and 
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double\_64} for the other variants.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% matrix formats %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmatrix
The matrix $\bmH$ may be stored in a variety of input formats.

\subsubsection{Dense storage format}\label{dense}
The matrix $\bmH$ is stored as a compact
dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
Since $\bmH$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
$h_{ij}$ for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$) need be held. In this case
the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
component $i \ast (i-1)/2 + j$ of the storage array {\tt H\%val}
will hold the value $h_{ij}$ (and, by symmetry, $h_{ji}$)
for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$.

\subsubsection{Sparse co-ordinate storage format}\label{coordinate}
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
For the $l$-th entry of $\bmH$, $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$,
its row index $i$, column index $j$ and value $h_{ij}$
are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer arrays {\tt H\%row},
{\tt H\%col} and real array {\tt H\%val}, respectively.
Note that only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.

\subsubsection{Sparse row-wise storage format}\label{rowwise}
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in row $i$ appear directly before those
in row $i+1$. For the $i$-th row of $\bmH$, the $i$-th component of the
integer array {\tt A\%ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while {\tt A\%ptr} $(m+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices $j$, $1 \leq j \leq i$, and values $h_{ij}$ of the
entries in the $i$-th row are stored in components
$l =$ {\tt H\%ptr}$(i)$, \ldots ,{\tt H\%ptr} $(i+1)-1$ of the
integer array {\tt H\%col}, and real array {\tt H\%val}, respectively.
Note that as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored.
For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
its predecessor.

%\subsubsection{Diagonal storage format}\label{diagonal}
%If $\bmH$ is diagonal (i.e., $h_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \neq j \leq n$)
%only the diagonals entries $h_{ii}$, $1 \leq i \leq n$,  need be stored,
%and the first $n$ components of the array {\tt H\%val} may be used for
%the purpose.

\galtypes
Five derived data types are accessible from the package.

%%%%%%%%%%% matrix data type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding matrices}\label{typesmt}
The derived data type {\tt SMT\_TYPE} is used to hold the matrices $\bmH$
and perhaps $\bmM$ and/or $\bmA$.
The components of {\tt SMT\_TYPE} used here are:

\begin{description}

\ittf{m} is a scalar component of type \integer,
that holds the number of rows in the matrix.

\ittf{n} is a scalar component of type \integer,
that holds the number of columns in the matrix.

\ittf{ne} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that
holds the number of matrix entries.

\ittf{type} is a rank-one allocatable array of type default \character, that
is used to indicate the matrix storage scheme used. Its precise length and
content depends on the type of matrix to be stored.

\ittf{val} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \realdp\,
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that holds the values of the entries.
Each pair of off-diagonal entries $h_{ij} = h_{ji}$ of the {\em symmetric}
matrix $\bmH$ is represented as a single entry
(see \S\ref{dense}--\ref{rowwise}).
Any duplicated entries that appear in the sparse
co-ordinate or row-wise schemes will be summed.

\ittf{row} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer,
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the row indices of the entries.
(see \S\ref{coordinate}).

\ittf{col} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer,
and dimension at least {\tt ne}, that may hold the column indices of the entries
(see \S\ref{coordinate}--\ref{rowwise}).

\ittf{ptr} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer,
and dimension at least {\tt n + 1}, that may holds the pointers to
the first entry in each row (see \S\ref{rowwise}).

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%% control type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding control
 parameters}\label{typecontrol}
The derived data type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
is used to hold controlling data. Default values may be obtained by calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
(see Section~\ref{subinit}). The components of
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
are:

\begin{description}
\itt{error} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that holds the
stream number for error messages.
Printing of error messages in
{\tt \packagename\_solve} and {\tt \packagename\_terminate}
is suppressed if ${\tt error} \leq {\tt 0}$.
The default is {\tt error = 6}.

\ittf{out} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that holds the
stream number for informational messages.
Printing of informational messages in
{\tt \packagename\_solve} is suppressed if ${\tt out} < {\tt 0}$.
The default is {\tt out = 6}.

\itt{print\_level} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that is used
to control the amount of informational output which is required. No
informational output will occur if ${\tt print\_level} \leq {\tt 0}$. If
{\tt print\_level = 1} a single line of output will be produced for each
iteration of the process. If {\tt print\_level} $\geq$ {\tt 2} this output
will be increased to provide significant detail of each iteration.
The default is {\tt print\_level = 0}.

\itt{new\_h} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that is used
to indicate how $\bmH$ has changed (if at all) since the previous call
to {\tt \packagename\_solve}. Possible values are:
\begin{description}
\itt{0} $\bmH$ is unchanged.
\itt{1} the values in $\bmH$ have changed, but its nonzero structure
is as before.
\itt{2} both the values and structure of $\bmH$ have changed.
\end{description}
The default is {\tt new\_h = 2}.

\itt{taylor\_max\_degree} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that specifies the maximum degree of Taylor approximant that will be used
to approximate the secular function when trying to improve $\lambda$;
a first-degree approximant results in Newton's method.
The higher the degree, the better in general the improvement, but the larger the
cost. Thus there is a balance between many cheap low-degree approximants
and a few more expensive higher-degree ones. Our experience favours
higher-degree approximants.
The default is {\tt taylor\_max\_degree = 3}, which is the highest degree
currently supported.

\itt{eigen\_min} is a scalar variables of type \realdp, that specifies the
smallest allowable value of an eigenvalue of the block diagonal factor of
$\bmH$. Any eigenvalue smaller than {\tt eigen\_min}
will be set to {\tt eigen\_min} when constructing $\bmM$.
See Section~\ref{galmethod} for more details.
The default is $\sqrt{u}$, where $u$ is
{\tt EPSILON(1.0)} ({\tt EPSILON(1.0D0)} in {\tt \fullpackagename\_double}).

\itt{lower} is a scalar variables of type \realdp, that holds the value
of any known lower bound on the required multiplier $\lambda_*$. A good lower
bound may sometimes dramatically improve the performance of the package, but
an incorrect value might cause the method to fail. Thus resetting
{\tt lower} from its default should be used with caution.
The default is {\tt lower = - HUGE(1.0)}
({\tt -HUGE(1.0D0)} in {\tt \fullpackagename\_double}).

\itt{upper} is a scalar variables of type \realdp, that holds the value
of any known upper bound on the required multiplier $\lambda_*$. A good upper
bound may sometimes dramatically improve the performance of the package, but
an incorrect value might cause the method to fail. Thus resetting
{\tt upper} from its default should be used with caution.
The default is {\tt upper = HUGE(1.0)}
({\tt HUGE(1.0D0)} in {\tt \fullpackagename\_double}).

\itt{stop\_normal} and {\tt stop\_absolute\_normal}
are scalar variables of type \realdp,
that hold values for the standard convergence tolerances of the method
(see Section~\ref{galmethod}).
In particular, the method is deemed to have converged for the trust-region
subproblem when the
computed solution $\bmx$ and its multiplier $\lambda$ satisfy either
$\lambda = 0$ and $|\|\bmx\|_{\bmM} < \Delta$ or
$\|\bmx\|_{\bmM} -  \Delta| \leq \max($ {\tt stop\_normal} $\ast \; \Delta,$
{\tt stop\_absolute\_normal}$)$,
while convergence in the regularization case happens when
$\|\bmx\|_{\bmM} -  (\lambda/\sigma)^{1/(p-2)} \leq$ {\tt stop\_normal}
\linebreak $\ast \max(1,\|\bmx\|_{\bmM},(\lambda/\sigma)^{1/(p-2)})$.
The defaults are {\tt stop\_normal = \tt stop\_absolute\_normal =}
$u^{0.75}$,
where $u$ is {\tt EPSILON(1.0)} ({\tt EPSILON(1.0D0)} in
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double}).

\itt{goldfarb} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
may be set \true\ if the user wishes the package to use Goldfarb's
method to build $\bmM$ from $\bmH$, and \false\ if the modified-absolute-value
method is to be used instead.
The default is {\tt goldfarb = \false}.

\itt{space\_critical} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
may be set \true\ if the user wishes the package to allocate as little
internal storage as possible, and \false\ otherwise. The package may
be more efficient if {\tt space\_critical} is set \false.
The default is {\tt space\_critical = \false}.

\itt{deallocate\_error\_fatal} is a scalar variable of type default \logical,
that may be set \true\ if the user wishes the package to return to the user
in the unlikely event that an internal array deallocation fails,
and \false\ if the package should be allowed to try to continue.
The default is {\tt deallocate\_error\_fatal = \false}.

\itt{symmetric\_linear\_solver} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 30, that specifies the external package to be used to
solve any symmetric linear system that might arise. Current possible
choices are {\tt 'sils'}, {\tt 'ma27'}, {\tt 'ma57'}, {\tt 'ma77'},
{\tt 'ma86'}, {\tt 'ma97'}, {\tt ssids}, {\tt 'pardiso'}
and {\tt 'wsmp'},
although only {\tt 'sils'} and, for OMP 4.0-compliant compilers,
{\tt 'ssids'} are installed by default.
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SLS} for further details.
The default is {\tt symmetric\_linear\_solver = 'sils'}.

\itt{prefix} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 30, that may be used to provide a user-selected
character string to preface every line of printed output.
Specifically, each line of output will be prefaced by the string
{\tt prefix(2:LEN(TRIM(prefix))-1)},
thus ignoring the first and last non-null components of the
supplied string. If the user does not want to preface lines by such
a string, they may use the default {\tt prefix = ""}.

\itt{SLS\_control} is a scalar variable of type
{\tt SLS\_control\_type} that is used to control various aspects of the
factorization package {\tt SLS}. See the documentation for
{\tt \libraryname\_SLS} for more details.

 information}\label{typetime}

that gives the status of the last internal array allocation
or deallocation. This will be 0 if {\tt status = 0}.

\itt{bad\_alloc} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 80, that  gives the name of the last internal array
for which there were allocation or deallocation errors.
This will be the null string if {\tt status = 0}.

 + \bmc^T \bmx + f + \sfrac{1}{p} \sigma \|\bmx\|_{\bmM}^p$.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%% data type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding problem data}\label{typedata}

is used to hold all the data for a particular problem between calls of

to the final call to

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% argument lists %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galarguments
There are three procedures for user calls
(see Section~\ref{galfeatures} for further features):

\begin{enumerate}
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_initialize}
      is used to set default values and initialize private data.
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_solve}
      is called to compute the desired matrix $\bmM$ and then solve the
      appropriate quadratic subproblem.
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_resolve}
      is used to resolve the problem when
      the only data that has changed since the last solution are the
      values of the radius $\Delta$ or the regularization weight $\sigma$
      and, optionally, the linear and constant terms $\bmc$ and $f$.
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_terminate}
      is provided to allow the user to automatically deallocate array
       components of the private data, allocated by
       {\tt \packagename\_solve},
       at the end of the solution process.
\end{enumerate}
We use square brackets {\tt [ ]} to indicate \optional\ arguments.

%%%%%% initialization subroutine %%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Further features %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galfeatures
\noindent In this section, we describe an alternative means of setting
control parameters, that is components of the variable {\tt control} of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}),
by reading an appropriate data specification file using the
subroutine {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}. This facility
is useful as it allows a user to change  {\tt \packagename} control parameters
without editing and recompiling programs that call {\tt \packagename}.

A specification file, or specfile, is a data file containing a number of
"specification commands". Each command occurs on a separate line,
and comprises a "keyword",
which is a string (in a close-to-natural language) used to identify a
control parameter, and
an (optional) "value", which defines the value to be assigned to the given
control parameter. All keywords and values are case insensitive,
keywords may be preceded by one or more blanks but
values must not contain blanks, and
each value must be separated from its keyword by at least one blank.
Values must not contain more than 30 characters, and
each line of the specfile is limited to 80 characters,
including the blanks separating keyword and value.

The portion of the specification file used by
{\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
must start
with a "{\tt BEGIN \packagename}" command and end with an
"{\tt END}" command.  The syntax of the specfile is thus defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  ( .. lines ignored by DPS_read_specfile .. )
    BEGIN DPS
       keyword    value
       .......    .....
       keyword    value
    END
  ( .. lines ignored by DPS_read_specfile .. )
\end{verbatim}
where keyword and value are two strings separated by (at least) one blank.
The ``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiter command lines
may contain additional (trailing) strings so long as such strings are
separated by one or more blanks, so that lines such as
\begin{verbatim}
    BEGIN DPS SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
    END DPS SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
are acceptable. Furthermore,
between the
``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiters,
specification commands may occur in any order.  Blank lines and
lines whose first non-blank character is {\tt !} or {\tt *} are ignored.
The content
of a line after a {\tt !} or {\tt *} character is also
ignored (as is the {\tt !} or {\tt *}
character itself). This provides an easy manner to "comment out" some
specification commands, or to comment specific values
of certain control parameters.

The value of a control parameters may be of three different types, namely
integer, logical or real.
Integer and real values may be expressed in any relevant Fortran integer and
floating-point formats (respectively). Permitted values for logical
parameters are "{\tt ON}", "{\tt TRUE}", "{\tt .TRUE.}", "{\tt T}",
"{\tt YES}", "{\tt Y}", or "{\tt OFF}", "{\tt NO}",
"{\tt N}", "{\tt FALSE}", "{\tt .FALSE.}" and "{\tt F}".
Empty values are also allowed for
logical control parameters, and are interpreted as "{\tt TRUE}".

The specification file must be open for
input when {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
is called, and the associated device number
passed to the routine in device (see below).
Note that the corresponding
file is {\tt REWIND}ed, which makes it possible to combine the specifications
for more than one program/routine.  For the same reason, the file is not
closed by {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}.

Control parameters corresponding to the components
{\tt SLS\_control}
and
{\tt IR\_control} may be changed by including additional sections enclosed by
``{\tt BEGIN SLS}'' and
``{\tt END SLS}'', and
``{\tt BEGIN IR}'' and
``{\tt END IR}'', respectively.
See the specification sheets for the packages
{\tt \libraryname\_SLS}
and
{\tt \libraryname\_IR}
for further details.

\subsubsection{To read control parameters from a specification file}
\label{readspec}

Control parameters may be read from a file as follows:
\hskip0.5in
\def\baselinestretch{0.8} {\tt \begin{verbatim}
     CALL DPS_read_specfile( control, device )
\end{verbatim}}
\def\baselinestretch{1.0}

\begin{description}
\itt{control} is a scalar \intentinout argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}).
Default values should have already been set, perhaps by calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, individual components of {\tt control} may have been changed
according to the commands found in the specfile. Specfile commands and
the component (see Section~\ref{typecontrol}) of {\tt control}
that each affects are given in Table~\ref{specfile}.

\bctable{|l|l|l|}

\hline

\ectable{\label{specfile}Specfile commands and associated
components of {\tt control}.}

\itt{device} is a scalar \intentin argument of type \integer,
that must be set to the unit number on which the specfile
has been opened. If {\tt device} is not open, {\tt control} will
not be altered and execution will continue, but an error message
will be printed on unit {\tt control\%error}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Information printed %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galinfo
If {\tt control\%print\_level} is positive, information about the progress
of the algorithm will be printed on unit {\tt control\-\%\-out}.
If {\tt control\%print\_level = 1}, a single line of output will be produced
for each iteration of the process. In the first phase of the algorithm,
this will include the current estimate of the multiplier and known
brackets on its optimal value. In the second phase, the residual
$\|\bmx\|_{\bmM} - \Delta$ (in the trust-region case), the current
estimate of the multiplier and the size of the correction will be printed.
If {\tt control\%print\_level} $\geq$ {\tt 2}, this
output will be increased to provide significant detail of each iteration.
This extra output includes times for various phases.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% METHOD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmethod
The required solution $\bmx_*$ necessarily satisfies the optimality condition
$\bmH \bmx_* + \lambda_* \bmM \bmx_* + \bmc = \bmzero$,
where $\lambda_* \geq 0$ is a Lagrange
multiplier that corresponds to the constraint
$\|\bmx\|_{\bmM}  \leq  \Delta$ in the trust-region case \req{trs},
and is given by $\lambda_* = \sigma \|\bmx_*\|^{p-2}$
for the regularization problem \req{rqs}.
In addition $\bmH + \lambda_* \bmM$ will be positive semi-definite; in
most instances it will actually be positive definite, but in special
``hard'' cases singularity is a possibility.

The matrix $\bmH$ is decomposed as
\disp{\bmH = \bmP \bmL \bmD \bmL^T \bmP^T}
by calling the \galahad\ package {\tt SLS}.
Here $\bmP$ is a permutation matrix,
$\bmL$ is unit lower triangular and $\bmD$ is block diagonal, with
blocks of dimension at most two. The spectral decomposition of each diagonal
block of $\bmD$ is computed, and each eigenvalue $\theta$ is replaced by
$\max ( | \theta | , \theta_{\min} ) $,
where $\theta_{\min}$ is a positive user-supplied value. The resulting block
diagonal matrix is $\bmB$, from which we define the ``modified-absolute-value''
\disp{\bmM = \bmP \bmL \bmB \bmL^T \bmP^T;}
an alternative due to Goldfarb uses instead the simpler
\disp{\bmM = \bmP \bmL \bmL^T \bmP^T.}

Given the factors of $\bmH$ (and $\bmM$), the required solution is
found by making the change of variables $\bmy = \bmB^{\half} \bmL^T \bmP^T \bmx$
(or $\bmy = \bmL^T \bmP^T \bmx$ in the Goldfarb case)
which results in ``diagonal'' trust-region and regularization subproblems,
whose solution may be easily obtained suing a Newton or higher-order iteration
of a resulting ``secular'' equation.
If subsequent problems, for which
$\bmH$ and $\bmc$ are unchanged, are to be attempted, the existing
factorization and solution may easily be exploited.

The dominant cost is that for the factorization of the symmetric, but
potentially indefinite, matrix $\bmH$ using the \galahad\ package {\tt SLS}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galexample
Suppose we wish to solve the trust-region subproblem \req{trs} in 10 unknowns,
whose data is
\disp{\bmH  = \mat{ccccc}{ -2 & 1 \\ 1 & -2 & . \\ & . & . & . \\ & & . & -2 & 1
                           \\ & & & 1 & -2 }, \;\;
\bmc  =  \vect{ 1 \\ 1 \\ . \\ 1 \\ 1 }
\tim{and}
f=0,}
with a radius $\Delta = 1$
and then to change the first component of
$c$ to 2, and to resolve with radii $\Delta = 1$ and $\Delta = 10$.
Then we may use the following code:

{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageexample}
}
\noindent
This produces the following output:
{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageresults}
}
If, instead, we wish to solve the cubic ($p=3$) regularization subproblem
\req{rqs} using the same problem data and initial weight $\sigma = 1$,
and then to change the first component of $c$ to 2, and to resolve
with weights $\sigma = 1$ and $\sigma = 0.1$, the following code
is suitable:
{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageexampleb}
}
\noindent
This produces the following output:
{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageresultsb}
}
