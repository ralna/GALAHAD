%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary

This package
{\bf finds a symmetric row and column permutation $\bmP \bmA \bmP^T$ 
of a symmetric, sparse matrix $\bmA$ with the aim of limiting 
the fill-in during subsequent Cholesky-like factorization}. 
The package is actually a wrapper to the {\tt METIS\_NodeND} 
procedure from versions 4.0, 5.1 and 5.2 of the
{\tt METIS} package from the Karypis Lab; Versions 5 are freely 
available under an open-source licence, and included here, 
while Version 4 requires a more restrictive licence, and a separate download, 
see {\tt https://github.com/KarypisLab}; if Version 4 is not provided,
a dummy will be substituted.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO USE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galhowto

%\subsection{Calling sequences}

%The package is available with either 32-bit or 64-bit integers, 
%and the subsidiary {\tt SMT\_type} package may use
%single, double and (if available) quadruple precision reals.
%Access to the 32-bit integer,
%single precision version requires the {\tt USE} statement
%\medskip

%\hspace{8mm} {\tt USE \fullpackagename\_single}

%\medskip
%\noindent
%with the obvious substitution 
%{\tt \fullpackagename\_double},
%{\tt \fullpackagename\_quadruple},
%{\tt \fullpackagename\_single\_64},
%{\tt \fullpackagename\_double\_64} and
%{\tt \fullpackagename\_quadruple\_64} for the other variants.

\input{versions}

\noindent
If it is required to use more than one of the modules at the same time, 
the derived types
{\tt SMT\_type},
{\tt \packagename\_control\-\_type}
and
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
(\S\ref{galtypes}),
and the subroutines
{\tt \packagename\-\_initialize},
{\tt \packagename\-\_order}
and
{\tt \packagename\-\_order\-\_adjacency},
(\S\ref{galarguments})
must be renamed on one of the {\tt USE} statements.

\noindent There are three principal subroutines for user calls.

\begin{description}
\item[]{\tt \packagename\_initialize} is used to set or re-initialize 
 default control and information values.

\item[] {\tt \packagename\_order} takes the (symmetric) pattern of $\bmA$
 and finds a symmetric permutation $\bmP$ so that the fill-in
 during Cholesky-like factorizations of $\bmP \bmA \bmP^T$
 is kept small.

\item[] {\tt \packagename\_order\_adjacency} takes the adjacency graph of 
 the (whole) pattern of $\bmA$, and performs the same task as
 {\tt \packagename\_order}. This package is actually called
 by its predecessor, but is provided for use by experts, and for
 those whose application is naturally in adjacency form.
\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% matrix formats %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmatrix
The sparsity pattern of the matrix $\bmA$ may be stored in 
a variety of input formats.

\subsubsection{Sparse co-ordinate storage format}\label{coordinate}
Only the nonzero entries of the lower-triangular part of $\bmA$ are stored.
For the $l$-th entry of the lower-triangular portion of $\bmA$,
its row index $i$ and column index $j$
are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer arrays 
{\tt row} and {\tt col}, respectively.
The order is unimportant, but the total number of entries
{\tt ne} is also required.

\subsubsection{Sparse row-wise storage format}\label{rowwise}
Again only the nonzero entries of the lower-triangular part are stored,
but this time they are ordered so that those in row $i$ appear directly
before those in row $i+1$. For the $i$-th row of $\bmA$, the $i$-th component
of an integer array {\tt ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while {\tt ptr} $(m+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices $j$ of the entries in the $i$-th row are 
stored in components $l =$ {\tt ptr}$(i)$, \ldots ,{\tt ptr} $(i+1)-1$ 
of the integer array {\tt col}.

For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
its predecessor.

\subsubsection{Dense storage format}\label{dense}
The matrix $\bmA$ is stored as a compact
dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
Since no indexing information is needed, no integer arrays are required.
Indeed, there no point in reordering a dense matrix, and this option
is simply included for completeness.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% graph format %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galgraph
The sparsity pattern of $\bmA$ may also be stored as an adjacency graph.
For each column of $\bmA$, a list of indices of rows of the whole of 
$\bmA$ (that is, both triangles) that correspond to nonzero entries are 
recorded; by convention for column $j$, if row $j$ occurs, it is omitted. 
Two integer arrays {\tt IND} and {\tt PTR}
are used, and the row indices of column $j$ are stored as
{\tt IND(l)}, {\tt l} $=$ {\tt PTR}$(j)$, \ldots ,{\tt PTR} $(j+1)-1$.
for $j = 1,\ldots,n$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% kinds %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\input{kinds}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% derived types %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galtypes
Four derived data types are used by the package.

%%%%%%%%%%% problem type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding the matrix}\label{typeprob}
The derived data type {\tt SMT\_type} is used to hold the matrix $\bmA$.
The components of {\tt SMT\_type} used are:

\begin{description}

\ittf{n} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that holds
the order $n$ of the matrix  $\bmA$.
\restriction {\tt n} $\geq$ {\tt 1}.

\itt{type} is an allocatable array of rank one and type default \character, that
indicates the storage scheme used. If the
sparse co-ordinate scheme (see \S\ref{coordinate}) is used
the first ten components of {\tt type} must contain the
string {\tt COORDINATE}.
For the sparse row-wise storage scheme (see \S\ref{rowwise}),
the first fourteen components of {\tt type} must contain the
string {\tt SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS}, and
for dense storage scheme (see \S\ref{dense})
the first five components of {\tt type} must contain the
string {\tt DENSE}.
%and for the diagonal storage scheme (see \S\ref{diagonal}),
%the first eight components of {\tt type} must contain the
%string {\tt DIAGONAL}.

For convenience, the procedure {\tt SMT\_put}
may be used to allocate sufficient space and insert the required keyword
into {\tt type}.
For example, if $\bmA$ is to be stored in the structure {\tt A}
of derived type {\tt SMT\_type} and we wish to use
the co-ordinate scheme, we may simply
%\vspace*{-2mm}
{\tt
\begin{verbatim}
        CALL SMT_put( A%type, 'COORDINATE', istat )
\end{verbatim}
}
%\vspace*{-4mm}
\noindent
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SMT}
for further details on the use of {\tt SMT\_put}.

\itt{ne} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that
holds the number of entries in the {\bf lower triangular} part of $\bmA$
in the sparse co-ordinate storage scheme (see \S\ref{coordinate}).
It need not be set for any of the other schemes.

\itt{row} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer,
that holds the row indices of the {\bf lower triangular} part of $\bmA$
in the sparse co-ordinate storage
scheme (see \S\ref{coordinate}).
It need not be allocated for any of the other schemes.
Any entry whose row index lies out of the range $[$1,n$]$ will be ignored.

\itt{col} is a rank-one allocatable array variable of type \integer,
that holds the column indices of the {\bf lower triangular} part of
$\bmA$ in either the sparse co-ordinate
(see \S\ref{coordinate}), or the sparse row-wise
(see \S\ref{rowwise}) storage scheme.
It need not be allocated when the dense
%or diagonal storage schemes are used.
storage scheme is used.
Any entry whose column index lies out of the range $[$1,n$]$ will be ignored,
while the row and column indices of any entry from the
{\bf strict upper triangle} will implicitly be swapped.

\itt{ptr} is a rank-one allocatable array of size {\tt n+1} and type
\integer, that holds the starting position of
each row of the {\bf lower triangular} part of $\bmA$, as well
as the total number of entries plus one, in the sparse row-wise storage
scheme (see \S\ref{rowwise}). It need not be allocated for the
other schemes.

\end{description}
The derived type also has a {\tt val} component that may hold real values
that are not used here, but can be by other applications that share
a {\tt SMT\_type} variable.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Further features %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galcontrolfeatures
\noindent In this section, we describe an alternative means of setting
control parameters, that is components of the variable {\tt control} of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see \S\ref{typecontrol}),
by reading an appropriate data specification file using the
subroutine {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}. This facility
is useful as it allows a user to change  {\tt \packagename} control parameters
without editing and recompiling programs that call {\tt \packagename}.

A specification file, or specfile, is a data file containing a number of
``specification commands''. Each command occurs on a separate line,
and comprises a ``keyword'',
that is a string (in a close-to-natural language) used to identify a
control parameter, and
an (optional) "value", which defines the value to be assigned to the given
control parameter. All keywords and values are case insensitive,
keywords may be preceded by one or more blanks but
values must not contain blanks, and
each value must be separated from its keyword by at least one blank.
Values must not contain more than 30 characters, and
each line of the specification file is limited to 80 characters,
including the blanks separating keyword and value.

The portion of the specification file used by
{\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
must start
with a ``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' command and end with an
``{\tt END}'' command.  The syntax of the specfile is thus defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  ( .. lines ignored by METIS_read_specfile .. )
    BEGIN METIS
       keyword    value
       .......    .....
       keyword    value
    END
  ( .. lines ignored by METIS_read_specfile .. )
\end{verbatim}
where keyword and value are two strings separated by (at least) one blank.
The ``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiter command lines
may contain additional (trailing) strings so long as such strings are
separated by one or more blanks, so that lines such as
\begin{verbatim}
    BEGIN METIS SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
    END METIS SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
are acceptable. Furthermore,
between the
``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiters,
specification commands may occur in any order.  Blank lines and
lines whose first non-blank character is {\tt !} or {\tt *} are ignored.
The content
of a line after a {\tt !} or {\tt *} character is also
ignored (as is the {\tt !} or {\tt *}
character itself). This provides an easy way to ``comment out'' some
specification commands, or to comment specific values
of certain control parameters.

The value of a control parameter may be of three different types, namely
integer, character or real.
Integer and real values may be expressed in any relevant Fortran integer and
floating-point formats (respectively).
%Permitted values for logical
%parameters are "{\tt ON}", "{\tt TRUE}", "{\tt .TRUE.}", "{\tt T}",
%"{\tt YES}", "{\tt Y}", or "{\tt OFF}", "{\tt NO}",
%"{\tt N}", "{\tt FALSE}", "{\tt .FALSE.}" and "{\tt F}".
%Empty values are also allowed for
%logical control parameters, and are interpreted as "{\tt TRUE}".

The specification file must be open for
input when {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
is called, and the associated unit number
passed to the routine in {\tt device} (see below).
Note that the corresponding
file is rewound, which makes it possible to combine the specifications
for more than one program/routine.  For the same reason, the file is not
closed by {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}.

\subsubsection{To read control parameters from a specification file}
\label{readspec}

Control parameters may be read from a file as follows:
\hskip0.5in

\def\baselinestretch{0.8}
{\tt
\begin{verbatim}
     CALL METIS_read_specfile( control, device )
\end{verbatim}
}
\def\baselinestretch{1.0}

\begin{description}
\itt{control} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see \S\ref{typecontrol}).
Default values should have already been set, perhaps by calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, individual components of {\tt control} may have been changed
according to the commands found in the specfile. Specfile commands and
the component (see \S\ref{typecontrol}) of {\tt control}
that each affects are given in Table~\ref{specfile}.

\itt{device} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type \integer,
that must be set to the unit number on which the specification file
has been opened. If {\tt device} is not open, {\tt control} will
not be altered and execution will continue, but an error message
will be printed on unit {\tt control\%error}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galexample
We illustrate the use of the package on the symmetric matrix with structure
\disp{\mat{ccccc}{ \ast &      & \ast &      & \ast \\
                        & \ast &      &      &      \\
                   \ast &      & \ast &      &      \\
                        &      &      & \ast & \ast \\
                   \ast &      &      & \ast & \ast },}
where $\ast$ denotes a nonzero.
Then, we may use the following code to find a suitable nested-dissection 
permutation prior to Cholesky-like factorization.

{\tt \small

%with the following data

This produces the following output:

Alternatively, we may use the adjacency graph format to produce the same
ordering.
