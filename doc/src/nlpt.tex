%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary
This package defines a derived type capable of supporting the storage of
a variety of smooth {\bf nonlinear programming problems} of the form
\[
\min \, \bmf(\bmx)
\]
subject to the general constraints
\[
\bmc^l \leq \bmc(\bmx) \leq \bmc^u,
\]
and
\[
\bmx^l \leq \bmx \leq \bmx^u,
\]
where $\bmf$ is a smooth ``objective function'', where $\bmc(x)$ is a smooth
function from $\Re^n$ into $\Re^m$ and where inequalities are understood
componentwise. The vectors $\bmc^l \leq \bmc^u$ and $\bmx^l \leq \bmx^u$ are
$m$- and $n$-dimensional, respectively, and may contain components equal to
minus or plus infinity. An important function associated with the problem
is its Lagrangian
\[
\bmL( \bmx,\bmy, \bmz) = \bmf(\bmx) - \bmy^T\bmc(\bmx) - \bmz^T\bmx
\]
where $\bmy$ belongs to $\Re^m$ and $\bmz$ belongs to $\Re^n$.
The solution of such problem may require the storage of the objective
function's gradient 
\[
\bmg(\bmx) = \nabla_{\bmx} \bmf(\bmx),
\]
the $n \times n$ symmetric objective function's Hessian
\[
\bmH_f(\bmx) = \nabla_{\bmx\bmx} \bmf(\bmx)
\]
the $m \times n$ constraints' Jacobian whose $i$-th row is the 
gradient of the $i$-th constraint:
\[
\bme_i^T \bmJ(\bmx) = [ \nabla_{\bmx} \bmc_i(\bmx) ]^T,
\]
the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to $\bmx$,
\[
\bmg_L(\bmx,\bmy,\bmz) = \nabla_{\bmx} \bmL( \bmx,\bmy, \bmz)
\]
and of the Lagrangian's Hessian with respect to $\bmx$
\[
\bmH_L(\bmx,\bmy,\bmz) = \nabla_{\bmx\bmx} \bmL( \bmx,\bmy, \bmz).
\]
Note that this last matrix is equal to the Hessian of the objective function
when the problem is unconstrained ($m=0$), which autorizes us
to use the same symbol $\bmH$ for both cases.

\noindent
Full advantage can be taken of any zero coefficients in the matrices $\bmH$ 
or $\bmJ$.

\noindent
The module also contains subroutines that are designed for printing parts 
of the problem data, and for matrix storage scheme conversions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO USE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galhowto

The package is available using both single and double precision reals, 
and either 32-bit or 64-bit integers. Access to the 32-bit integer,
single precision version requires the {\tt USE} statement
\medskip

\hspace{8mm} {\tt USE \fullpackagename\_single}

\medskip
\noindent
with the obvious substitution {\tt \fullpackagename\_double},
{\tt \fullpackagename\_single\_64} and 
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double\_64} for the other variants.

\noindent
If it is required to use more than one of the modules at the same time, 
the derived type
{\tt NLPT\_problem\_type}, 
(Section~\ref{galtype})
must be renamed on one of the {\tt USE} statements.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% matrix formats %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmatrix
Both the Hessian matrix $\bmH$ and the Jacobian $\bmJ$
may be stored in one of three input formats (the format for the two matrices
being possibly different).

\subsubsection{Dense storage format}\label{dense}

The matrix $\bmJ$ is stored as a compact 
dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
Component $n \ast (i-1) + j$ of the storage array {\tt J\_val} will hold the 
value $J_{ij}$ for $i = 1, \ldots , m$, $j = 1, \ldots , n$.
Since $\bmH$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part 
$h_{ij}$ for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$) need be held. In this case
the lower triangle will be stored by rows, that is 
component $i \ast (i-1)/2 + j$ of the storage array {\tt H\_val}  
will hold the value $h_{ij}$ (and, by symmetry, $h_{ji}$)
for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$.

\noindent
If this storage scheme is used, {\tt J\_type} and/or {\tt H\_type} must be set
the value of the symbol {\sym GALAHAD\_DENSE}.

\subsubsection{Sparse co-ordinate storage format}\label{coordinate}

Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored. For the 
$l$-th entry of $\bmJ$, its row index $i$, column index $j$ 
and value $J_{ij}$
are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer arrays {\tt J\_row}, 
{\tt J\_col} and real array {\tt J\_val}. 
The order is unimportant, but the total
number of entries {\tt J\_ne} is also required. 
The same scheme is applicable to
$\bmH$ (thus requiring integer arrays {\tt H\_row}, {\tt H\_col}, a real array 
{\tt H\_val} and an integer value {\tt H\_ne}),
except that only the entries in the lower triangle need be stored.

\noindent
If this storage scheme is used, {\tt J\_type} and/or {\tt H\_type} must be set
the value of the symbol {\sym GALAHAD\_COORDINATE}.

\subsubsection{Sparse row-wise storage format}\label{rowwise}

Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in row $i$ appear directly before those
in row $i+1$. For the $i$-th row of $\bmJ$, the $i$-th component of a 
integer array {\tt J\_ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while {\tt J\_ptr} $(m+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices $j$ and values $J_{ij}$ of the entries in the $i$-th row 
are stored in components 
$l =$ {\tt J\_ptr}$(i)$, \ldots ,{\tt J\_ptr} $(i+1)-1$ of the 
integer array {\tt J\_col}, and real array {\tt J\_val}, respectively. 
The same scheme is applicable to
$\bmH$ (thus requiring integer arrays {\tt H\_ptr}, {\tt H\_col}, and 
a real array {\tt H\_val}),
except that only the entries in the lower triangle need be stored.
The values of {\tt J\_ne} and {\tt H\_ne} are not mandatory, since they can be
recovered from
\[
{\tt J\_ne} = {\tt J\_ptr}({\tt n}+1) - 1
\;\;\;\; \mbox{and} \;\;\;\;
{\tt H\_ne} = {\tt H\_ptr}({\tt n}+1) - 1
\]
For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than 
its predecessor.

\noindent
If this storage scheme is used, {\tt J\_type} and/or {\tt H\_type} must be set
the value of the symbol {\sym GALAHAD\_SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% optimality conditions %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Optimality conditions\label{galopt}}

The solution $\bmx$ necessarily satisfies 
the primal first-order optimality conditions
\[
\bmc^l \leq \bmc(\bmx) \leq \bmc^u,
\;\;\;\; \mbox{and} \;\;\;\;
\bmx^l \leq \bmx \leq \bmx^u,
\]
the dual first-order optimality conditions
\[
\bmg( \bmx ) = \bmJ(\bmx)^{T} \bmy + \bmz \;\;
\]
where
\[
\bmy = \bmy^{l} + \bmy^{u}, \;\;
 \bmz = \bmz^{l} + \bmz^{u}\,\,
 \bmy^{l} \geq 0 , \;\;
 \bmy^{u} \leq 0 , \;\;
 \bmz^{l} \geq 0 \tim{and}
 \bmz^{u} \leq 0 ,
\]
and the complementary slackness conditions 
\disp{
 (\bmc(\bmx) -\bmc^l)^{T} \bmy^{l} = 0  ,\;\;
 ( \bmc(\bmx) - \bmc^{u} )^{T} \bmy^{u} = 0  ,\;\;
 (\bmx -\bmx^{l} )^{T} \bmz^{l} = 0   \tim{and}
 (\bmx -\bmx^{u} )^{T} \bmz^{u} = 0 ,}
where the vectors $\bmy$ and $\bmz$ are 
known as the Lagrange multipliers for
the general constraints, and the dual variables for the bounds,
respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold componentwise.
The dual first-order optimality condition is equivalent to
the condition that $\bmg_L( \bmx,\bmy, \bmz) = 0$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% argument lists %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galarguments
There are seven procedures for user calls:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The subroutine {\tt \packagename\_write\_stats} 
      is used to write general information on the problem such
      as the number of variables and constraints of different types.
\item The subroutine {\tt \packagename\_write\_variables}
      is used to write the current values of the problem's variables, bounds
      and of their associated duals.

      is used to write the current values of the problem's constraints, bounds
      and of their associated multipliers.
\item The subroutine {\tt \packagename\_write\_problem}
      is used to write the problem's number of variables and
      constraints per type, as well as current values of the problem's 
      variables and constraints. This broadly corresponds to successively 
      calling the three subroutines mentioned above. The subroutine
      additionally (optionally) writes the values of the Lagrangian's Hessian
      $\bmH$ and constraints Jacobian $\bmJ$.
\item The subroutine {\tt \packagename\_J\_from\_C\_to\_Srow}

\item The subroutine {\tt \packagename\_J\_from\_C\_to\_Scol}
      builds the permutation that transforms the Jacobian from
      coordinate storage to sparse-by-column storage, as well as the
      {\tt J\_ptr} and {\tt J\_row} vectors.

\subsubsection{Transforming the Jacobian from co-ordinate storage to
sparse-by-columns}
\label{toScol}

The permutation that transforms the Jacobian from co-ordinate 
storage to sparse-by-columns, as well as the associated {\tt ptr} and {\tt row}
vectors can be obtained by the call
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_J\_perm\_from\_C\_to\_Scol( problem, perm, row, ptr )}

\noindent where
\begin{description}
\itt{problem} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type {\tt
NLPT\_problem\_type}, that holds the Jacobian matrix to transform. Note that
we must have {problem\%J\_type} $=$ {\sym GALAHAD\_COORDINATE}.

\itt{perm} is an allocatable to a vector \intentout\ of type \integer\ and
dimension equal to {\tt problem\%J\_nnz}, that returns the permutation of the
elements of {\tt problem\%J\_val} that must be applied to transform the
Jacobian from co-ordinate storage to sparse-by-columns.

\ittf{col} is an allocatable to a vector \intentout\ of type \integer\ and
dimension {\tt problem\%J\_ne} whose $k$-th component is the row index of 
the $k$-th element of {\tt problem\%J\_val} after permutation by {\tt perm}.

\ittf{ptr} is an allocatable to a vector \intentout\ of type \integer\ and
dimension {\tt problem\%m} $+1$ whose $i$-the component is the index in {\tt
problem\%J\_val} (after permutation by {\tt perm}) of the first entry of column
$i$. Moreover,
\[
{\tt ptr}({\tt problem\%m}+1 ) = {\tt problem\%J\_ne} + 1.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galexample
Suppose we wish to present the data for the problem of minimizing
the objective function
$(\bmx_1 - 2 ) \bmx_2$
subject to the constraints
$\bmx_1^2 +\bmx_2^2 \leq 1$,
$0 \leq -\bmx_1 + \bmx_2 $, and the simple bound
$0 \leq  \bmx_1$, where the values are computed at the point
$\bmx^T = (0,1)$, which, together with the values $z_1 = 1$
and $\bmy^T = ( -1, 0 )$ defines a first-order critical point for the problem.
Assume that we wish to store the Lagrangian's Hessian and the Jacobian in
co-ordinate format. Assume also that we wish to write this data.  We may
accomplish these objectives by using the code:
