The package is available with single, double and (if available) 
quadruple precision reals, and either 32-bit or 64-bit integers. 
Access to the 32-bit integer,
single precision version requires the {\tt USE} statement

\hspace{8mm} {\tt USE \fullpackagename\_single}

\medskip
\noindent
with the obvious substitution 
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double},
{\tt \fullpackagename\_quadruple},
{\tt \fullpackagename\_single\_64},
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double\_64} and
{\tt \fullpackagename\_quadruple\_64} for the other variants.
