GALAHAD packages:

LANCELOT B: a sequential augmented Lagrangian method for
minimizing a (nonlinear) objective subject to general (nonlinear) constraints
and simple bounds.

FILTRANE: finds a feasible point for a system of equations and inequalities
using a trust-region filter method.

QPB: a primal-dual interior-point trust-region method for
minimizing a general quadratic objective function over a polyhedral region.
(HSL_VE12 in HSL)

QPA: an active/working-set method for
minimizing a general quadratic objective function over a polyhedral region.
