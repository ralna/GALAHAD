GALAHAD packages:

LANCELOT B: a sequential augmented Lagrangian method for 
minimizing a (nonlinear) objective subject to general (nonlinear) constraints
and simple bounds.

FILTRANE: finds a feasible point for a system of equations and inequalities
using a trust-region filter method.

minimizing a general quadratic objective function over a polyhedral region.
(HSL_VE12 in HSL)

QPA: an active/working-set method for 
minimizing a general quadratic objective function over a polyhedral region.
