\lsection{Introduction}

We released our large-scale nonlinear programming package \lan\
[\bciteb{ConnGoulToin92}] late in 1991. Over the intervening
years, \lana\ has been used by a large number of people, both
via free source downloads from our WWW sites
and by means of the NEOS facility [\bciteb{CzyzMessMore98}]
from the Optimization Technology Center at
Argonne National Laboratory and Northwestern University in the USA.
It is fair to say that we (and others) recognised its limitations
from the outset, and it has long been our goal eventually to provide
a suitable successor.

\lana\ was written in Fortran 77.
Despite the widespread availability of good
Fortran~77 compilers, the limitations of the language, particularly
the absence of standardised memory allocation facilities, proved to be
a serious limitation, especially for large problems.
Work started in 1995 on a Fortran 90 implementation,
particularly to take advantage of the new language's
memory manipulation features and array constructs, and by 1997 we had a
working prototype of the improved \lanb. We had chosen to stay with
Fortran rather than C, say, partially because many of the package's
key (external) components, most especially the \citebb{hsl:2002}
sparse matrix codes
produced by our colleagues, are all Fortran based, and also because
we believed (and still believe) Fortran 90 capable of providing
all of the facilities we needed.

Regrettably, at or around that time, a number of our colleagues
had started to release the results of comparative tests of their
new codes---for instance SNOPT [\bciteb{gillmurrsaun02:siopt}],
LOQO [\bciteb{VandShan99}],
KNITRO [\bciteb{ByrdHribNoce99:siopt}], and
FilterSQP [\bciteb{FletLeyf02}]---against \lana,
and the results made frankly rather depressing reading for us
[\bciteb{DolaMore00}, \bciteb{BensShanVand01}, and \bciteb{Chin01}], \lan\
often, but far from always, being significantly outperformed.
Quite clearly, the promise always held for large-scale
sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods,
based on how they outperformed other techniques in comparative tests
such as those due to \cite{HockSchi81}, was now being realised, and the
limit of what might be achieved by augmented Lagrangian methods
such as \lana\ had probably been reached.

Reluctantly, we abandoned any plans to release \lanb\ at that time, and turned
our attention instead to SQP methods. To our minds, there had never
really been much doubt that SQP methods would be more successful in the
long term, but there had been  general concerns over
how to solve (approximately) their all-important (large-scale) quadratic
programming (QP) subproblems. Thus, we decided that our next goal
should be to produce high-quality QP codes for eventual incorporation
in our own SQP algorithm(s). Since we believe that there might
be considerable interest from others in such codes, we have decided to release
these before we have finalised our SQP solver(s). And since we realised that
far from producing a single package, we are now in effect building a
library of independent but inter-related packages, we have chosen to
release an (evolving) large-scale nonlinear optimization library, \gal.

In some sense \gal\ Version 1.0 is a stop-gap, since, although
it includes the upgraded B version of \lan, we doubt seriously whether
\lanb\ is a state-of-the-art solver for general nonlinear programming
problems. What \gal\ V1.0 does provide are the quadratic programming solvers
and related tools that we anticipate will allow us to develop the
next-generation SQP solvers
we intend to introduce in Version 2 of the library.

%In this paper, we describe the scope and content of \gal.

\lsection{Library contents}

Each package in \gal\ is written as a Fortran 90 module, and the codes
are all threadsafe. The default
precision for real arguments is double, but this is easily transformed
to single in a UNIX environment using provided {\tt sed} scripts.
Each package has accompanying
documentation and a test program. The latter attempts to execute as
much of the package as
realistically possible. (The fact that some of the packages are
intended for nonlinear problems makes it difficult to ensure that
every statement is executed, since some segments of code are
intended to cope with pathological behaviour that cannot be ruled out
in theory but nevertheless seems never to occur in practice.)
Options to packages may be passed both directly, through subroutine arguments,
and indirectly, via option-specification files. The second mechanism is
particularly useful when there is a hierarchy of packages for which
a user wishes to change an option for one of the dependent packages without
recompilation.

\lsubsection{Overview}

\gal\ comprises the following major packages:

\begin{description}

\itt{LANCELOT B} is a sequential augmented Lagrangian method for
minimizing a (nonlinear) objective subject to general (nonlinear) constraints
and simple bounds.

\itt{QPB} is a primal-dual interior-point trust-region method for
minimizing a general quadratic objective function over a polyhedral region.

\itt{QPA} is an active/working-set method for
minimizing a general quadratic objective function over a polyhedral region.

\itt{LSQP} is an interior-point method for minimizing a linear or
separable convex quadratic function over a polyhedral region.

\itt{PRESOLVE} is a method for preprocessing linear and quadratic programming
problems prior to solution by other packages.

\itt{GLTR} is a method for minimizing a general quadratic objective function
over the interior or boundary of a (scaled) hyper-sphere.

\itt{SILS} provides an interface to the HSL sparse-matrix package {\tt MA27}
that is functionally equivalent to the more recent HSL package {\tt HSL\_MA57}.

\itt{SCU} uses a Schur complement update to find the solution of
a sequence of linear systems for which the solution
involving a leading sub-matrix may be found by other means.

\end{description}
In addition, \gal\ contains the following auxiliary packages:

\begin{description}

\itt{QPP} reorders linear and quadratic programming
problems to a convenient form prior to solution by other packages.

\itt{QPT} provides a derived type for holding linear and quadratic programming
problems.

\itt{SMT} provides a derived type for holding sparse matrices in a variety of
formats.

\itt{SORT} gives implementations of both Quick-sort and Heap-sort methods.

\itt{RAND} provides pseudo-random numbers.

\itt{SPECFILE} allows users to provide options to other packages, using lists
of keyword-value pairs given in package-dependent option-specification files.

\itt{SYMBOLS} assigns values to a list of commonly used \gal\ variables.

\end{description}

\subsection{Details of major \gal\ packages\label{major}}

\subsubsection{{\tt LANCELOT B}\label{lanb}}

\lana\ is fully described in \citebb{ConnGoulToin92}, and the results
of comprehensive tests are given in \citebb{ConnGoulToin96a}.
The enlivened \lanb\ offers a number of improvements over its predecessor.
New features include
\begin{itemize}
\item automatic allocation of workspace,
\item a non-monotone descent strategy [see \bciteb{Toin96b}, and
\bciteb{ConnGoulToin00}, \S10.1] to be used by default,
\item optional use of \citebb{MoreTora91}-type projections
   [see also \bciteb{LinMore99b}]
   during the subproblem solution phase,
\item an interface to \citebbs{LinMore99} public domain incomplete Cholesky
   factorization package ICFS for use as a preconditioner,
\item optional use of structured trust regions to model
   structured problems better [see \bciteb{ConnGoulSartToin96a}, and
   \bciteb{ConnGoulToin00}, \S10.2],
\item more flexibility over the choice of derivatives, which need
   only be provided for a subset of the element functions from which the
   problem is built, the remainder being estimated by differences or secant
   approximations.
\end{itemize}
The main reason for extending \lan's life is as a prototype
for what may be achieved using Fortran 90/95 in preparation for
future \gal\ SQP solvers, since the problem data structure and
interface is unlikely to change significantly.

To illustrate the effects of the new features,
both \lana\ and  \lanb\ (using a number of new options)
were run on all the examples (except linear and quadratic programs) from
the \cuter\ test set [\bciteb{GoulOrbaToin02b}]. The \cuter\
set differs from its predecessor
in \cute\ [\bciteb{BongConnGoulToin95}]
both in the number of problems and by virtue of a long-overdue
increase in default dimensions for all variable-dimensional problems.
The options new to \lanb\ that we considered were as follows:
\begin{itemize}
%\begin{enumerate}
\item The default: a non-monotone descent strategy with a
history length of 1, a band preconditioner with semi-bandwidth 5,
and exact second derivatives.
\item The default, except that a monotone descent strategy is used.
\item The default, except that SR1 approximations to the second derivatives
are used.
\item The default, except that the \citebbs{LinMore99} incomplete Cholesky
   factorization preconditioner, ICFS, with 5 extra work vectors, is used.
\item The default, except that the \citebb{MoreTora91} projected search,
with 5 restarts is used.
\item The default, except that a structured trust region
   [\bciteb{ConnGoulSartToin96a}] is used.
\item The default, except that the history length for the
non-monotone descent strategy is increased to 5.
%\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\lana\ was run with its defaults, since an exhaustive test
of other \lana\ options has already been performed
[\bciteb{ConnGoulToin96a}].

In Figure~\ref{prof.ps}
the performance profiles [\bciteb{DolaMore01}] for the CPU time
(in seconds) and the numbers of function evaluations
from these tests are reported. All experiments were performed
on a single processor of a Compaq AlphaServer DS20 with 3.5 Gbytes of RAM,
using the Compaq f90 compiler with full machine-specific optimization.
Runs were regarded as unsuccessful (and terminated) if they reached
30 minutes CPU time or 10000 function evaluations.
Of the 749 problems thus considered (and for the best of the
options), 151 (roughly 20\%)
were terminated for that reason or because
the evaluation of problem functions led to floating-point exceptions. Of
those requiring more than 30 minutes/10000 calls, most could ultimately
be solved by increasing the CPU and iteration limits.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=time.ps,height=10.0cm,silent=}
}\centerline{
            \psfig{figure=its.ps,height=10.0cm,silent=}}
\caption{Performance profile for LANCELOT options: CPU times (top)
and number of function evaluations (bottom). The horizontal axis
gives the argument $\sigma$, while the vertical axis records $p_i(\sigma)$
for each of the competing options, $i$.}
\label{prof.ps}
\end{figure}

Suppose that a given algorithm $i$ from a competing set $\calA$
reports a statistic $s_{ij} \geq 0$
when run on example $j$ from our test set $\calT$,
and that the smaller this statistic the better the algorithm is considered.
Let
\disp{k(s,s^*,\sigma) =
 \left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
 1 & \mbox{if} \;\; s \leq \sigma s^* \\ 0 & \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{array}
\right.
}
Then, the {\em performance profile} of algorithm $i$ is the function
\disp{p_i(\sigma) = \frac{
\sum_{j \in \calT} k(s_{i,j},s^*_{j},\sigma)}{|\calT|} \;\;\mbox{with}\;\;
\sigma \geq 1,}
where $s^*_j = \min_{i \in \calA} s_{ij}$.
Thus $p_i(1)$ gives the fraction of the number of examples for which
algorithm $i$ was the most effective (according to statistics $s_{ij}$),
$p_i(2)$ gives
the fraction for which algorithm $i$
is within a factor of 2 of the best, and $\lim_{\sigma\longrightarrow\infty}
p_i(\sigma)$ gives the fraction of examples for which the algorithm
succeeded. We consider such a profile to be a very effective means
of comparing algorithms and (in this case)
the relative merits of the new options available in \lanb.

The benefits of the non-monotone strategy
are apparent in terms of both CPU time and function evaluation reductions.
Likewise, the Lin-Mor\'{e} (for function evaluations)
and Mor\'{e}-Toraldo (for CPU time) options both prove to be advantageous.
In addition, we are pleased to see that
the best of the new options show some gain with respect to
\lana, particularly as we were initially concerned that moving from
Fortran 77 to 90 might give rise to some performance penalties.
The only new option that we are disappointed with is the use of a
structured trust region, and, on the basis of these tests,
we cannot really recommend this strategy. The full set of results
are available as an internal report [\bciteb{goulorbatoin02c}].

\ltsubsubsection{QPB}

The module {\tt QPB} is an implementation of a primal-dual
feasible interior-point trust-region method for quadratic programming.

To set the scene, the {\em quadratic programming} problem is to
\eqn{1.2}{\minin{x \in \smallRe^n} q(x) \equiv
\half x^T H x + g^T x}
subject to the general linear constraints
\eqn{1.3}{c_{i}^{l}  \leq  a_{i}^{T}x  \leq  c_{i}^{u}, \;\;\;
 i = 1, \ldots , m,}
and the simple bound constraints
\eqn{1.4}{x_{j}^{l}  \leq  x_{j}^{ } \leq  x_{j}^{u} , \;\;\;
 j = 1, \ldots , n,}
for given
vectors $g$, $a_{i}$, $c^{l}$, $c^{u}$, $x^{l}$, $x^{u}$
and a given symmetric (but not necessarily definite) matrix $H$. Equality
constraints and fixed variables are allowed by setting
$c_{i}^{u} = c_{i}^{l}$ and $x_{j}^{u} = x_{j}^{l}$ as required,
and any or all of the constraint bounds may be infinite.
The required solution $x$ to \req{1.2}--\req{1.4} satisfies
the primal optimality conditions
\eqn{4.1a}{A x = c}
and
\eqn{4.1b}{
 c^{l} \leq c \leq c^{u}, \;\;
x^{l} \leq x \leq x^{u},}
the dual optimality conditions
\eqn{4.2a}{
 H x + g =
 A^{T} y + z,\;\;
 y = y^{l} + y^{u} \tim{and}
 z = z^{l} + z^{u} ,}
and
\eqn{4.2b}{
 y^{l} \geq 0 , \;\;
 y^{u} \leq 0 , \;\;
 z^{l} \geq 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\;
 z^{u} \leq 0 ,}
and the complementary slackness conditions
\eqn{4.3}{
( A x - c^{l} )^{T} y^{l} = 0  ,\;\;
( A x - c^{u} )^{T} y^{u} = 0  ,\;\;
(x -x^{l} )^{T} z^{l} = 0   \tim{and}
(x -x^{u} )^{T} z^{u} = 0 ,}
where $c$ is an additional vector of primal variables,
the vectors $y$ and $z$ are Lagrange multipliers for
the general linear constraints and the dual variables for the bounds,
respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold componentwise.

Primal-dual interior-point methods iterate towards a point
that satisfies the optimality conditions \req{4.1a}--\req{4.3}
by ultimately aiming to satisfy
\req{4.1a}, \req{4.2a} and \req{4.3}, while ensuring that
\req{4.1b} and \req{4.2b} are
satisfied as strict inequalities at each stage.
Appropriate norms of the amounts by
which \req{4.1a}, \req{4.2a} and \req{4.3} fail to be satisfied are known as the
primal and dual infeasibility, and the violation of complementary slackness,
respectively. The fact that \req{4.1b} and \req{4.2b} are satisfied as strict
inequalities gives such methods their name, interior-point methods.

The problem is solved in two phases. The goal of the first
``initial feasible point'' phase is
to find a strictly interior point that is primal feasible (satisfies
\req{4.1a}). The \gal\ package {\tt LSQP} (see \S\ref{LSQP})
is used for this purpose, and offers the options of either accepting the first
strictly feasible point found, or preferably of aiming for the
so-called ``analytic center'' of the feasible region.
Given such a suitable initial feasible point, the second ``optimality''
phase ensures that \req{4.1a} remains satisfied while iterating to
satisfy dual feasibility \req{4.2a} and complementary slackness \req{4.3}.
It proceeds by approximately minimizing a
sequence of barrier functions
\disp{q(x) - \mu \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log ( c_{i}  -  c_{i}^{l} )
 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log ( c_{i}^{u}  -  c_{i} )
 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \log ( x_{j}  -  x_{j}^{l} )
 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \log ( x_{j}^{u}  -  x_{j} ) \right] ,}
for an appropriate sequence of positive barrier parameters $\mu$
converging to zero,
while ensuring that \req{4.1a} remains satisfied and that
$x$ and $c$ are strictly interior points for \req{4.1b}.
Note that terms in the above summations corresponding to infinite bounds are
ignored, and that equality constraints are treated specially.

Each of the barrier subproblems is solved using a trust-region method.
Such a method generates a trial correction step $(\delta x, \delta c)$
to the current iterate $(x, c)$
by replacing the nonlinear barrier function locally by a suitable
quadratic model, and approximately minimizing this model in the
intersection of \req{4.1a}
and a trust region $\|( \delta x,  \delta c)\| \leq \Delta$
for some appropriate
positive trust-region radius $\Delta$ and norm $\| \cdot \|$.
The step is accepted/rejected
and the radius adjusted on the basis of how accurately the model reproduces the
value of the barrier function at the trial step. If the step proves to be
unacceptable, a linesearch is performed along the step to obtain an acceptable
new iterate. In practice, the natural primal ``Newton'' model of the barrier
function is almost always
less successful than an alternative primal-dual model,
and consequently the primal-dual model is usually to be preferred.

The trust-region subproblem is approximately solved using the
combined conjugate-gradient/Lan\-czos method [see \bciteb{GoulHribNoce98} and
\bciteb{GoulLuciRomaToin99:siopt}] implemented in the \gal\ module {\tt GLTR}
(see \S\ref{GLTR}).
Such a method requires a suitable preconditioner,
and in our case, the only flexibility we have is in approximating the
model of the Hessian. Although using a fixed form of preconditioning is
sometimes effective, we have provided the option of an automatic choice
that aims to balance the cost of applying the preconditioner against
the need for an accurate solution of the trust-region subproblem.
The preconditioner is applied using the \gal\ factorization package
{\tt SILS} (see \S\ref{SILS})---or optionally using {\tt HSL\_MA57}
from HSL if this is available---but options at this stage are
to factorize the preconditioner as a whole (the so-called ``augmented system''
approach) or to perform a block elimination first (the ``Schur-complement''
approach). The latter is usually to be preferred when a (non-singular) diagonal
preconditioner is used, but may be inefficient if any of the columns
of $A$ is too dense.

The theoretical justification of the
overall scheme, for problems with general objectives and
inequality constraints,
is given by \citebb{ConnGoulOrbaToin00:mp}, in which we also present
numerical results that suggest it is indeed able to solve
some problems of the size we had been aiming for.
More recently, we investigated the ultimate rate of convergence
of such schemes, and have shown that, under fairly general conditions,
a componentwise superlinear rate is achievable for both quadratic and general
nonlinear programs [\bciteb{GoulOrbaSartToin01}].

Full advantage is taken of any zero elements in the matrix $H$ or the
vectors $a_{i}$.
An older version of {\tt QPB} (using {\tt HSL\_MA57} rather than {\tt SILS},
see \S\ref{SILS}, but without some of the most recent features in {\tt QPB})
is available commercially as {\tt HSL\_VE12} within HSL.

\ltsubsubsection{QPA}

The module {\tt QPA} is an implementation of a second approach
to quadratic programming, this time of the active/working set variety.
{\tt QPA} is primarily intended within \gal\ to deal with the case
where a good
estimate of the optimal active set has been determined (so that
relatively few iterations will be required). The method is actually more
general in scope, and is geared toward solving
{\em $\mathbf{\ell_1}$-quadratic programming} problems of the form
\eqn{1.1}{\minin{x \in \smallRe^n} m(x, \rho_g, \rho_b ) \eqdef
q(x) + \rho_g v_g(x) + \rho_b v_b(x)}
involving the quadratic objective $q(x)$ and the infeasibilities
\disp{v_g(x) =
   \sum_{i=1}^{m} \max ( c_{i}^{l} - a_i^T x, 0 )
 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \max ( a_i^T x - c_{i}^{u}, 0 )}
and
\disp{v_b(x) =
   \sum_{j=1}^{n} \max ( x_{j}^{l} - x_{j}  , 0 )
 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \max ( x_{j}  - x_{j}^{u} , 0 ) .}

At the $k$-th iteration of the method, an improvement to the value
of the merit function $m(x, \rho_g, \rho_b )$
at $x = x^{(k)}$ is sought. This is achieved by first
computing a search direction $s^{(k)}$
and then setting $x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + \alpha^{(k)} s^{(k)}$,
where the stepsize $\alpha^{(k)}$ is chosen as the first local minimizer of
$\phi ( \alpha ) = m( x^{(k)} + \alpha s^{(k)} , \rho_g, \rho_b )$
as $\alpha$ increases from zero.
The stepsize calculation is straightforward, and exploits the fact that
$\phi ( \alpha )$ is a piecewise quadratic function of $\alpha$.

The search direction is defined by a subset of the ``active'' terms in
$v(x)$, i.e., those for which
$a_i^T x = c_i^l$ or $c_i^u$ (for $i=1,\ldots ,m$) or
$x_j = x_j^l$ or $x_j^u$ (for $j=1,\ldots ,n$).
The ``working set'' $W^{(k)}$ is chosen as the intersection of
subsets of indices $i$ and $-j$ from the active terms, and is such
that its members have linearly independent gradients.
The search direction $s^{(k)}$ is chosen as an approximate solution of
the equality-constrained quadratic program
\eqn{4.1}{\minin{s \in \smallRe^n}
m\s{Q}(s) \eqdef q(x^{(k)} + s) +
 \rho_g l_g^{(k)} (s) + \rho_b l_b^{(k)} (s),}
subject to
\eqn{4.2}{a_i^T s = 0,\;\;  i \in \{ 1, \ldots , m \} \cap W^{(k)},
\tim{and}
x_j = 0, \;\;  - j  \in \{-1, \ldots , -n \} \cap W^{(k)},}
where
\disp{l_g^{(k)} (s) =
     - \sum_{\stackrel{i=1}{a_i^T x < c_i^l}}^m a_i^T s
    \; + \sum_{\stackrel{i=1}{a_i^T x > c_i^u}}^m a_i^T s}
and
\disp{l_b^{(k)} (s) =
    - \sum_{\stackrel{j=1}{x_j < x_j^l}}^n s_j
    \; + \sum_{\stackrel{j=1}{x_j > x_j^u}}^n s_j .}
The equality-constrained quadratic program \req{4.1}--\req{4.2} is solved by
a projected preconditioned conjugate gradient
method [\bciteb{GoulHribNoce98}]. The method terminates
if the solution is found, or if a pre-specified iteration limit is reached,
or if a direction of infinite descent is located, along which $m\s{Q}(s)$
decreases without bound within the feasible region \req{4.2}.
Successively more accurate approximations are required as suspected
solutions of \req{1.1} are approached.

Preconditioning of the conjugate gradient iteration
requires the solution of one or more linear systems of the form
\eqn{4.3a}{\mat{cc}{M^{(k)} & A^{(k)T} \\ A^{(k)} & 0 }
\vect{ p \\ u} = \vect{ g \\ 0 },}
where $M^{(k)}$ is a ``suitable'' approximation to $H$
and the rows of $A^{(k)}$ comprise the gradients of the
terms in the current working set. Rather than recomputing a
factorization of the preconditioner at every iteration, we use a
Schur complement method, recognising the fact that
gradual changes occur to successive working sets. The main
iteration is divided into a sequence of ``major'' iterations.
At the start of each major iteration (say, the overall iteration $l$),
a factorization of the
current ``reference'' matrix
\eqn{4.4}{\mat{cc}{M^{(l)} & A^{(l)T} \\ A^{(l)} & 0 }}
is obtained using  the \gal\ factorization package
{\tt SILS} (see \S\ref{SILS})---or, once again,
optionally using {\tt HSL\_MA57} from HSL if this is available.
This reference matrix may be factorized as a whole (the
augmented system approach). Alternatively, systems involving \req{4.4} may
be solved by performing a block elimination of $p$
and then factorizing $A^{(l)} M^{(l)-1} A^{(l)T}$
(the ``Schur-complement'' approach). The latter is usually to be preferred
when a (non-singular) diagonal
preconditioner is used, but may be inefficient if any of the columns
of $A^{(l)}$ is too dense.
Subsequent iterations within the current major
iteration obtain solutions to \req{4.3a} via the factors of \req{4.4}
and an appropriate (dense) Schur complement,
obtained from {\tt SCU} in \gal\ (see \S\ref{SCU}).
The major iteration terminates
once the space required to hold the factors of the (growing) Schur
complement exceeds a given threshold.

The working set changes by (a)
the addition of an active term encountered during
the determination of the stepsize, or (b) the removal of a term if $s = 0$
solves \req{4.1}--\req{4.2}. The  decision on which to remove in the latter
case is based upon the expected decrease upon the removal of an individual term,
and this information is available from the magnitude and sign of the components
of the auxiliary vector $u$ computed in \req{4.3a}. At optimality, the
components of $u$ for $a_i$ terms will all lie between
$0$ and $\rho_g$---and those for the other terms
between $0$ and $\rho_b$---and any violation
of this rule indicates further progress is possible.
%The components
%of $u$ corresponding to the terms involving $a_i^T x$
%are sometimes known as Lagrange multipliers (or generalized gradients) and
%denoted by $y$, while those for the remaining $x_j$ terms are dual variables
%and denoted by $z$.

To solve quadratic programs of the form \req{1.2}--\req{1.4},
a sequence of problems of the form \req{1.1} are
solved, each with a larger value of $\rho_g$ and/or $\rho_b$
than its predecessor. The
required solution has been found once the infeasibilities
$v_g(x)$ and $v_b(x)$ have been reduced to zero at the solution of
\req{1.1} for the given $\rho_g$ and $\rho_b$.

Having proposed and implemented two very different quadratic programming
methods, one might ask: how do the methods compare? We examined
this question in \citebb{GoulToin01c} by comparing {\tt QPA} and {\tt QPB}
on the \cuter\ QP test set [\bciteb{GoulOrbaToin02b}].

While for modest sized problems, started from ``random'' points, the two
methods are roughly comparable, the advantages of the interior-point approach
become quite clear when problem dimensions increase. For problems involving
tens of thousands of unknowns and/or constraints, our active set approach
simply takes too many iterations, while the number of iterations
required by the interior point approach seems relatively insensitive to
problem size. For general problems involving hundreds of thousands or
even millions of unknowns/constraints, the active set approach is impractical,
while we illustrate in Table~\ref{figa} that
{\tt QPB} is able to solve problems of this size.
{\tt QPB} also appears to scale well with dimension, as can be seen
see in Table~\ref{figb}.

While such figures might seem to indicate that {\tt QPB} should always
be preferred to {\tt QPA}, this is not the case. In particular, if a
good estimate of the solution---more particularly, the optimal active
set---is known, active-set methods may exploit this,
while interior-point methods
are (currently) less able to do so. In particular
\citebb{GoulToin01c} illustrate that {\tt QPA} often outperforms {\tt QPB}
on warm-started problems unless the problem is (close to) degenerate or
very ill conditioned. Thus, since nonlinear optimization (SQP) algorithms
often solve a sequence of related problems for which the optimal active sets
are almost or actually identical, there is good reason to maintain both
{\tt QPA} and {\tt QPB} in \gal.

An enhanced version of {\tt QPA} (using {\tt HSL\_MA57} rather than {\tt SILS},
see \S\ref{SILS}) is available commercially as {\tt HSL\_VE19} within HSL.

\ltsubsubsection{LSQP}

{\tt LSQP} is an interior-point method for minimizing a linear or
separable convex quadratic function
\disp{\mbox{minimize}\;\; \half {\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2
 ( x_{i}^{ } - x_{i}^{0} )^{2}} + g^T x,}
for given weights $w$ and gradient $g$,
over the polyhedral region \req{1.3}--\req{1.4}.
In the special case where $w = 0$ and $g = 0$
the so-called analytic center of the feasible set will be found,
while linear programming, or constrained least distance, problems
may be solved by picking $w = 0$, or $g = 0$, respectively.
The basic algorithm is that of \citebb{Zhan94}.
{\tt LSQP} is used within \gal\ by {\tt QPB} to find an initial
strictly-interior feasible point (see \S\ref{QPB}).

Note that since predictor-corrector steps are not taken, the method
is unlikely to be as efficient as state-of-the-art interior-point
methods for linear programming. We intend to remedy this defect for
Version 2.

\ltsubsubsection{PRESOLVE}

The module {\tt PRESOLVE} is intended to pre-process
quadratic programming problems of the form \req{1.2}--\req{1.4}.
The purpose is to exploit the
optimality equations \req{4.1a}--\req{4.3} so as to simplify the problem
and reduce the problem to a standard form (that makes subsequent
manipulation easier), defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The variables are ordered so that their bounds appear in the order
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
free                &          &        & $x_j$ &        &          \\
non-negativity      &   0      & $\leq$ & $x_j$ &        &          \\
lower               & $x^l_j$ & $\leq$ & $x_j$ &        &          \\
range               & $x^l_j$ & $\leq$ & $x_j$ & $\leq$ & $x^u_j$ \\
upper               &          &        & $x_j$ & $\leq$ & $x^u_j$ \\
non-positivity      &          &        & $x_j$ & $\leq$ &      0   \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Fixed variables are removed. Within each category, the variables
are further ordered so that those with non-zero diagonal Hessian
entries occur before the remainder.

\item
The constraints are ordered so that their bounds appear in the order
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
non-negativity      &     0    & $\leq$ & $( A x)_i$ &        &          \\
equality            & $c^l_i$ &   $=$  & $(A x)_i$ &        &          \\
lower               & $c^l_i$ & $\leq$ & $(A x)_i$ &        &          \\
range               & $c^l_i$ & $\leq$ & $(A x)_i$ & $\leq$ & $c^u_i$ \\
upper               &          &        & $(A x)_i$ & $\leq$ & $c^u_i$ \\
non-positivity      &          &        & $(A x)_i$ & $\leq$ &     0    \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Free constraints are removed.

\item
In addition, constraints may be removed or bounds tightened, to reduce the
size of the feasible region or simplify the problem if this is possible, and
bounds may be tightened on the dual variables and the multipliers
associated  with the problem.
\end{itemize}

The presolving algorithm [\bciteb{GoulToin01}]
proceeds by applying a (potentially long) series of
simple transformations to the problem.
These involve the removal of empty and
singleton rows, the removal of redundant and forcing primal constraints, the
tightening of primal and dual bounds, the exploitation of
empty, singleton, and doubleton colums,
merging of dependent
variables, row ``sparsification'' and splitting equalities. Transformations are
applied in successive passes, each pass involving the following actions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item remove empty and singletons rows,
\item try to eliminate variables that do not appear in the linear constraints,
\item attempt to exploit the presence of singleton columns,
\item attempt to exploit the presence of doubleton columns,
\item complete the analysis of the dual constraints,
\item remove empty and singleton rows,
\item possibly remove dependent variables,
\item analyze the primal constraints,
\item try to make $A$ sparser by combining its rows,
\item check the current status of the variables, dual variables
      and multipliers for optimality or infeasibility.
\end{enumerate}
All these transformations are applied on the structure of the original
problem, which is only permuted to standard form after all transformations are
completed. The reduced problem may
then be solved by a quadratic or linear programming solver. Finally, the
solution of the simplified problem is re-translated to the
variables/constraints format of the original problem in a ``restoration'' phase.

At the overall level, the presolving process follows one of the following two
sequences:

\vspace*{0.2cm}

\noindent
\begin{center}
\fwbox{initialize}
$\rightarrow$ $\bigg[$ \fwbox{apply transformations}
$\rightarrow$ (solve problem)
$\rightarrow$ \fwbox{restore}  $\bigg]$
$\rightarrow$ \fwbox{terminate}
\end{center}
\vspace*{0.2cm}

\noindent or

\vspace*{0.2cm}
\noindent
\begin{center}
\fwbox{initialize}
$\rightarrow$ $\bigg[$ \fwpbox{read specfile}
$\rightarrow$ \fwpbbox{apply\\transformations}
$\rightarrow$ $\left(\mbox{\parbox{.5in}{solve problem}}\right)$
$\rightarrow$ \fwbox{restore}  $\bigg]$
$\rightarrow$ \fwbox{terminate}
\end{center}
\vspace*{0.2cm}

\noindent
where the procedure's control parameter may be modified by reading an external
``specfile'', and where (solve problem) indicates
that the reduced problem is solved. Each of the ``boxed'' steps in these
sequences corresponds to calling a specific routine of the package, while
a bracketed subsequence of steps means that they can be repeated with problems
having the same structure.

\citebb{GoulToin01} indicate that, when considering all 178 linear
and quadratic programming problems in the \cute\ test set
[\bciteb{BongConnGoulToin95}],
an average reduction of roughly 20\% in both the number of unknowns and
the number of constraints results from applying {\tt PRESOLVE}.
With the \gal\ QP solver {\tt QPB} (see \S\ref{QPB}),
an overall average reduction
of roughly 10\% in CPU time results. In some cases, the gain is dramatic.
For example, for the problems {\tt GMNCASE4}, {\tt STNPQ1}, {\tt STNQP2}
and {\tt SOSQP1}, {\tt PRESOLVE}
removes all the variables and constraints, and thus reveals the complete
solution to the problem without resorting to a QP solver.

Currently {\tt PRESOLVE} is not embedded within {\tt QPA}/{\tt B} or
{\tt LSQP} and must be called separately, but we intend to correct this
defect for Version 2.0.

\ltsubsubsection{GLTR}

{\tt GLTR} aims to find the global solution to the problem of minimizing
the quadratic function \req{1.2} where the variables are
required to satisfy the constraint $\|x\|_{M} \leq  \Delta$,
where the $M$-norm of $x$ is $\|x\|_{M} = \sqrt{x^T M x}$ for some symmetric,
positive definite $M$, and where $\Delta > 0$ is a given scalar.
This problem commonly occurs as a trust-region subproblem in nonlinear
optimization methods, and is used within \gal\ by {\tt QPB}.
The method may be suitable for large $n$ as no factorization of $H$ is
required. Reverse communication is used to obtain
matrix-vector products of the form $H z$ and $M^{-1} z$.
The package may also be used to solve the related problem in which $x$ is
instead required to satisfy the equality constraint $\|x\|_{M} = \Delta$.
The method is described in detail in
\citebb{GoulLuciRomaToin99:siopt}, and {\tt GLTR} is a slightly improved
version of the HSL package {\tt HSL\_VF05}.

\ltsubsubsection{SILS}

The module {\tt SILS} provides a Fortran 90 interface to the Fortran 77 HSL
sparse linear equation package {\tt MA27} \cite{DuffReid82}.
The interface and functionality are
designed to be identical to the more recent HSL Fortran 90
package {\tt HSL\_MA57} \cite{Duff01}, enabling anyone with {\tt HSL\_MA57}
to substitute this easily for {\tt SILS} throughout \gal. The reason
that we are forced to rely on {\tt MA27} rather than the superior
{\tt HSL\_MA57} by default is simply that
the former is available without charge from the HSL Archive
({\tt http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/hslarchive}), while the latter is only available
commercially.
{\tt SILS} (and hence either {\tt MA27} or {\tt HSL\_MA57})
is required by {\tt QPA}/{\tt B} and {\tt LSQP}, and is
used optionally by {\tt LANCELOT B}.

\ltsubsubsection{SCU}

{\tt SCU} may be used to find the solution
to an extended system of $n + m$
sparse real linear equations in $n  +  m$ unknowns,
\disp{\mat{cc}{ A & B \\ C & D } \vect{x_1 \\ x_2}
 =  \vect{b_1 \\ b_2}.}
in the case where the $n$ by $n$ matrix $A$ is nonsingular
and solutions to the systems
\disp{A x  =  b \tim{and} A^T y  =  c}
may be obtained from an external source, such as an existing
factorization.  The subroutine uses reverse communication to obtain
the solution to such smaller systems.  The method makes use of
the Schur complement matrix
\disp{S  =  D  -  C    A^{-1} B.}
The Schur complement is stored and updated in factored form as a dense matrix
(using either Cholesky or QR factors as appropriate)
and the subroutine is thus appropriate only if there is
sufficient storage for this matrix. Special advantage is taken
of symmetry and definiteness of the matrices $A$, $D$ and $S$.
Provision is made for introducing additional rows and columns
to, and removing existing rows and columns from, the extended matrix.

{\tt SCU} is used by both \lanb\ and {\tt QPA} to cope
with core linear systems that arise as constraints and variables
enter and leave their active/working sets. A slightly simplified
version of {\tt SCU} is available in HSL as {\tt HSL\_MA69}.

\lsection{Installation}

Just as for its immediate predecessors \cuter\ and \sifdec\
[see \bciteb{GoulOrbaToin02b}],
\gal\ is designed to be used in a multi-platform, multi-compiler
environment in which core (source and script) files are available
in a single location, and machine/compiler/operating system specific
components (most especially compiled libraries of binaries) are isolated in
uniquely identifiable subdirectories. As before, we have concentrated on
UNIX and Linux platforms, principally because we have no experience with
other systems.

\gal\ is provided as a series of directories and files, all lying beneath
a root directory that we shall refer to as {\tt \$GALAHAD}. The
directory structure is illustrated in Figure~\ref{dir_structure}.

\end{figure}

Before installation the sub-directories
{\tt objects},
{\tt modules},
{\tt makefiles},
{\tt versions}
and
{\tt bin/sys}
will all be empty. The script {\tt install\_galahad} prompts
the user for the answers to a series of questions aimed at determining
what machine type, operating system and compiler (from a large list of
predefined possibilities encoded in the {\tt arch} sub-directory)
to build \gal\ for---we
call this combination of a machine, operating system and
compiler an \emph{architecture}. Each architecture is assigned a simple
(mnemonic) architecture {\em code} name, say {\tt architecture}---for example
a version for the NAG Fortran 95 compiler on a PC runing Linux is
coded {\tt pc.lnx.n95}, while another for the
Compaq Fortran 90 compiler on an Alpha system running Tru64 Unix is
{\tt alp.t64.f90}.
Having determined the architecture, the installation script
builds sub-directories of {\tt objects} and {\tt modules} named
{\tt architecture}, as well as further sub-directories
{\tt double} and {\tt single} of these to hold architecture-dependent
compiled libraries and module file information. In addition,
architecture-dependent makefile information and environment variables for
execution scripts are placed in files named {\tt architecture} in the
{\tt makefiles} and {\tt bin/sys} sub-directories, and a file recording how
the code is related to the architecture is put in {\tt versions}.

The Fortran source codes for each \gal\ package occurs
in a separate sub-directory of the {\tt src} directory. The sub-directory
contains the package source, a comprehensive test program (along with
a simpler second test program, which is used as an illustration on how
to call the package in the accompanying documentation), and a makefile.
Since the order of compilation of Fortran modules is important, and as
we have seen there is a strong interdependency between the \gal\ packages,
the makefiles have to be carefully crafted. For this reason,
we have chosen not to use variants of tools such as
{\tt imake} to build and
maintain the makefiles. Postscript and PDF Documentation for all packages
is contained in {\tt doc}.

Not every component of \gal\ is distributed as part of the package. In
particular, the HSL Archive code {\tt MA27} must be downloaded prior to
the installation from
\begin{verbatim}
    http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/archive/hslarchive.html
\end{verbatim}
before any of the QP packages can be used (it is optionally used by \lanb).
Additionally \gal\ makes optional use of the
Lin-Mor\'{e} preconditioner {\tt ICFS}, available as
part of the MINPACK 2 library via
\begin{verbatim}
    http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~more/icfs/ ,
\end{verbatim}
and the HSL codes {\tt MA57} and {\tt MC61}, which are only available
commercially. If any non-default code is used, the file {\tt packages}
in the directory {\tt src/makedefs} must be edited to describe where
the external code may be found---details are given in {\tt packages}.
Default dummy versions of all optional codes are provided in
{\tt src/dum} to ensure that linking prior to execution works properly.

Once the correct directory structure is in place, the installation script
builds a random-access library of the required precision by visiting each
of the sub-directories of {\tt src} and calling the Unix utility {\tt make}.
\gal\ packages are all written in double precision, but if a user prefers to
use single precision, the makefiles call suitable Unix {\tt sed}
scripts (stored in {\tt seds}) to transform the source prior to compilation.
A user may choose to install all of \gal, or just the QP or \lanb\ components.
There are also {\tt sed} features to switch automatically from {\tt SILS} (see
 \S\ref{SILS}) to {\tt MA57} if the latter is available.
The command {\tt make tests} runs comprehensive tests of all
compiled components.

\section{Interfaces to the \cuter\ test set}

As well as providing stand-alone Fortran modules, we provide
interfaces between \lanb, {\tt QPA}/{\tt B}, {\tt LSQP} and {\tt PRESOLVE} and
problems written in the Standard Input Format (SIF)
[\bciteb{ConnGoulToin92}], most particularly
the \cuter\ test set [\bciteb{GoulOrbaToin02b}]. To use these
interfaces \lanb\ users will need to have installed
\sifdec\ (from {\tt http://cuter.rl.ac.uk/cuter-www/sifdec}),
while users wishing to use the interfaces to the QP packages
will additionally need \cuter\
(from  {\tt http://cuter.rl.ac.uk/cuter-www}).

To run one of the supported packages on an example stored in
{\tt EXAMPLE.SIF}, say, a user needs to issue the command
\begin{verbatim}
    sdgal code package EXAMPLE[.SIF]
\end{verbatim}
where {\tt code} is the architecture code discussed in \S\ref{Installation},
{\tt package} defines the package to be used---it may be one of {\tt lanb},
{\tt qpa}, {\tt qpb} or {\tt pre}, with access to {\tt LSQP}
provided via {\tt qpb}---and the suffix [{\tt .SIF}] is optional.
This command translates the SIF file into Fortran subroutines and
related data using the decoder provided in \sifdec, and then calls
the required optimization package to solve the problem. Once a problem
has been decoded, it may be re-used (perhaps with different options)
using the auxiliary command
\begin{verbatim}
    gal code package
\end{verbatim}
A few SIF examples are given in the {\tt examples} sub-directory, while the
{\tt sdgal} and {\tt gal} commands are in the {\tt bin} sub-directory, and
have man-page descriptions in the {\tt man/man1} sub-directory.

One additional feature is that if the user has
access to the HSL automatic differentiation packages {\tt HSL\_AD01}
or {\tt HSL\_AD02} [\bciteb{PrycReid98}],
these may be used to generate automatic first and second derivatives
for the element and group functions [\bciteb{ConnGoulToin92}]
from which the overall problem is re-assembled by \cuter\ and \lanb.
Of course it would be better to use one of the more
commonly occurring packages
such as  ADIFOR [\bciteb{BiscCarlCorlGrieHovl92}],
and we plan to do this in the future.

As with \lana, options may be passed directly to the solvers by means of
user-definable option-specification files. Each SIF interface
has its own set of options, but overall control is maintained via
the \gal\ module {\tt SPECFILE}.

%\newpage
\lsection{Availability}

\gal\ may be downloaded from
{\tt http://galahad.rl.ac.uk/galahad-www} .
There are restrictions on commercial use, and all users are required to
agree to a number of minor conditions of use.

\lsection{Conclusions}

We have described the scope and design of the first release of \gal,
a library of Fortran 90 packages for nonlinear optimization.
Version 1.0 of the library particularly addresses quadratic programming
problems, although there is an updated version of \lan\ for more general
problems.

In future, we intend to use the quadratic programming packages as the
basic tool within one or more SQP methods for nonlinear optimization.
We are currently developing AMPL [\bciteb{FourGayKern93}] interfaces
for the principal packages so that users will be able to use a more
natural interface than provided by SIF. In addition, we plan to incorporate
the preprocessing tools as options within the QP solvers, rather than having
them stand-alone as at present.
