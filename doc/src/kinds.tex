%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% kinds %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galkinds
We use the terms integer and real to refer to the fortran
keywords {\tt REAL(rp\_)} and {\tt INTEGER(ip\_)}, where 
{\tt rp\_} and {\tt ip\_} are the relevant kind values for the
real and integer types employed by the particular module in use. 
The former are equivalent to
default {\tt REAL} for the single precision versions and 
{\tt DOUBLE PRECISION} for the double precision cases, and 
correspond to {\tt rp\_ = real32} and {\tt rp\_ = real64},
respectively, as supplied by the fortran {\tt iso\_fortran\_env} module.
The latter are default (32-bit) and long (64-bit) integers, and
correspond to {\tt ip\_ = int32} and {\tt ip\_ = int64},
respectively, again from the {\tt iso\_fortran\_env} module.
