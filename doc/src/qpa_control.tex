\itt{monitor\_residuals} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that
specifies the frequency at which working constraint residuals will be monitored
to ensure feasibility. The  residuals will be monitored every
{\tt monitor\_residu\-al} iterations.
The default is {\tt monitor\_residuals = 1}.

\itt{cold\_start} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that controls
the initial working set (see Section~\ref{galmethod})). Possible values are:
\begin{description}
\itt{0} a "warm start" will be performed. The values set in
     {\tt C\_stat} and {\tt B\_stat} indicate which
     constraints will be included in the initial working set.
     (see {\tt C\_stat} and {\tt B\_stat} in Section~\ref{qps}).
\itt{1} the constraints "active" at {\tt p\%X} (see Section~\ref{qps})
     will determine the initial working set.
\itt{2} the initial working set will be empty.
\itt{3} the initial working set will only contain equality constraints.

during the previous {\tt infeas\_check\_in\-terval} iterations, the
penalty parameter will be increased by a factor
{\tt increase\_rho\_b\_factor}.
The default is {\tt infeas\_im\-proved\_b\_by\_factor = 0.75}.

%\itt{pivot\_tol}  is a scalar variable of type default
%\realdp, that holds the
%threshold pivot tolerance used by the matrix factorization.  See
%the documentation for the package {\tt SILS} for details.
%The default is {\tt pivot\_tol =} $0.1 \sqrt{u}$,
%where $u$ is {\tt EPSILON(1.0)} ({\tt EPSILON(1.0D0)} in

%{\tt \fullpackagename\_dou\-ble}).

Any dual variable or Lagrange multiplier which is less than
{\tt multiplier\_tol} outside its optimal interval will be regarded
as being acceptable when checking for optimality.
The default is {\tt zero\_pivot =} $\sqrt{u}$,
where $u$ is {\tt EPSILON(1.0)} ({\tt EPSILON(1.0D0)} in
{\tt \fullpackagename\_dou\-ble}).

{\tt cpu\_time\_limit = - 1.0}.

\itt{clock\_time\_limit} is a scalar variable of type \realdp,
that is used to specify the maximum permitted elapsed system clock time.
Any negative value indicates no limit will be imposed. The default is
{\tt clock\_time\_limit = - 1.0}.

\itt{treat\_zero\_bounds\_as\_general} is a scalar variable of type
default \logical.
If it is set to \false, variables which
are only bounded on one side, and whose bound is zero,
will be recognised as non-negativities/non-positivities rather than simply as
lower- or upper-bounded variables.
If it is set to \true, any variable bound
$x_{j}^{l}$ or $x_{j}^{u}$ which has the value 0.0 will be
treated as if it had a general value.
Setting {\tt treat\_zero\_bounds\_as\_general} to \true\ has the advantage
that if a sequence of problems are reordered, then bounds which are
``accidentally'' zero will be considered to have the same structure as
those which are nonzero. However, {\tt \fullpackagename} is
able to take special advantage of non-negativities/non-positivities, so
if a single problem, or if a sequence of problems whose
bound structure is known not to change, is/are to be solved,
it will pay to set the variable to \false.
The default is {\tt treat\_zero\_bounds\_as\_general = .FALSE.}.

\ifthenelse{\equal{\package}{qpa}}{
\itt{solve\_qp} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
must be set \true\ if the algorithm will aim to solve the quadratic
programming problem \req{1.2}--\req{1.4}
(by adjusting $\rho_g$ and $\rho_b$ as necessary), and
and \false\ if the solution of the $l_1$-quadratic program
for the specified values of $\rho_g$ and $\rho_b$ is required.
The default is {\tt solve\_qp = .FALSE.}.

\itt{solve\_within\_bounds} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
must be set \true\ if the algorithm will aim to solve
the bound-constrained $\mathbf{\ell_1}$ quadratic programming problem
\req{1.4}--\req{1.5} (by adjusting $\rho_b$ as necessary), and
and \false\ otherwise.
If {\tt solve\_qp} is \true, the value of {\tt solve\_within\_bounds}
will be ignored. The default is {\tt solve\_within\_bounds = .FALSE.}.
}{}

\itt{ramdomize} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
must be set \true\ if the user wishes to perturb the constraint bounds
by small random quantities during the first stage of the solution process,

helps when solving degenerate problems and is usually to be recommended.
The default is {\tt randomize = .TRUE.}.

%\itt{array\_syntax\_worse\_than\_do\_loop} is a scalar variable of type
%default \logical, that should be set \true\ if the compiler is
%better able to optimize Fortran 77-style do-loops than to exploit
%Fortran 95-style array syntax when performing vector operations,
%and \false\ otherwise.
%The default is {\tt array\_syntax\_worse\_than\_do\_loop = .FALSE.}.

\itt{symmetric\_linear\_solver} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 30, that specifies the external package to be used to
solve any symmetric linear system that might arise. Current possible

and {\tt 'wsmp'},

and length 30, that specifies the external package to be used to
solve any symmetric positive-definite linear system that might arise.
Current possible
choices are {\tt 'sils'}, {\tt 'ma27'}, {\tt 'ma57'}, {\tt 'ma77'},
{\tt 'ma86'}, {\tt 'ma87'}, {\tt 'ma97'}, {\tt ssids}, {\tt 'pardiso'}
and {\tt 'wsmp'},
although only {\tt 'sils'} and, for OMP 4.0-compliant compilers,
{\tt 'ssids'} are installed by default.
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SLS} for further details.
The default is {\tt definite\_linear\_solver = 'sils'}.

\itt{prefix} is a scalar variable of type default \character\
and length 30, that may be used to provide a user-selected
character string to preface every line of printed output.
Specifically, each line of output will be prefaced by the string
{\tt prefix(2:LEN(TRIM(prefix))-1)},
thus ignoring the first and last non-null components of the
supplied string. If the user does not want to preface lines by such
a string, they may use the default {\tt prefix = ""}.

\itt{SLS\_control} is a scalar variable argument of type
{\tt SLS\_control\_type} that is used to pass control
options to external packages used to
factorize relevant symmetric matrices that arise.
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SLS} for further details.

{\tt SLS\_control\%rela\-tive\_pivot\_tolerance} is reset to
{\tt pivot\_tol}.
