%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary

This package
{\bf solves dense or sparse symmetric systems of linear equations}
using variants of Gaussian elimination.
Given a sparse symmetric matrix $\bmA = \{ a_{ij} \}_{n \times n}$, and an
$n$-vector $\bmb$ or a matrix $\bmB = \{ b_{ij} \}_{n \times r}$, this
subroutine solves the system $\bmA \bmx = \bmb$ or the system $\bmA
\bmX = \bmB$ . The matrix $\bmA$ need not be definite.

\noindent The method provides a common interface to a variety of well-known
solvers from HSL and elsewhere. Currently supported solvers include
{\tt MA27/SILS}, {\tt HSL\_MA57}, {\tt HSL\_MA77} , {\tt HSL\_MA86},
{\tt HSL\_MA87} and {\tt HSL\_MA97} from {HSL},
{\tt SSIDS} from {SPRAL},
{\tt MUMPS} from Mumps Technologies,
{\tt PARDISO} both from the Pardiso Project and Intel's MKL,
{\tt PaStiX} from Inria, and
{\tt WSMP} from the IBM alpha Works, 
as well as {\tt POTR}, {\tt SYTR} and {\tt SBTR} from LAPACK.
Note that, with the exception of {\tt SSIDS} and the Netlib
reference LAPACK codes,
{\bf the solvers themselves do not form part of this package and
must be obtained separately.}
Dummy instances are provided for solvers that are unavailable.
Also note that additional flexibility may be obtained by calling the
solvers directly rather that via this package.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO USE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galhowto

\subsection{Calling sequences}

The package is available using both single and double precision reals, 
and either 32-bit or 64-bit integers. Access to the 32-bit integer,
single precision version requires the {\tt USE} statement
\medskip

\hspace{8mm} {\tt USE \fullpackagename\_single}

\medskip
\noindent
with the obvious substitution {\tt \fullpackagename\_double},
{\tt \fullpackagename\_single\_64} and 
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double\_64} for the other variants.

\noindent
If it is required to use more than one of the modules at the same time, 
the derived types
{\tt SMT\_type},
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type},
{\tt \packagename\_time\-\_type},
{\tt \packagename\_data\-\_type}, and
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
(\S\ref{galtypes}),
and the subroutines
{\tt \packagename\_initialize},
{\tt \packagename\_analyse},
{\tt \packagename\-\_factorize},
{\tt \packagename\_solve},
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}
(\S\ref{galarguments}),
{\tt \packagename\_enquire},
{\tt \packagename\_alter\_d}, and
{\tt \packagename\_part\_solve}
(\S\ref{galfeatures})
must be renamed on one of the {\tt USE} statements.

\noindent There are five principal subroutines for user calls (see
\S\ref{galfeatures} for further features):

\begin{description}

\item[] The subroutine {\tt \packagename\_initialize} must be called to
specify the external solver to be used.
It may also be called to set default values
for solver-specific components of the control structure.
If non-default values are
wanted for any of the control components, the corresponding components
should be altered after the call to {\tt \packagename\_initialize}.

\item[] {\tt \packagename\_analyse} accepts the pattern of $\bmA$
 and optionally chooses pivots
 for Gaussian elimination using a selection criterion to preserve
 sparsity.  It subsequently constructs subsidiary information for
 actual factorization by {\tt \packagename\_factorize}. If the user provides
 the pivot sequence, only the necessary information for
 {\tt \packagename\_factorize} will be generated.

\item[] {\tt \packagename\_factorize} factorizes the matrix $\bmA$ using the
 information
 from a previous call to {\tt \packagename\_analyse}. The actual pivot sequence
 used may differ from that of {\tt \packagename\_analyse} if $\bmA$ is not
definite.

\item[] {\tt \packagename\_solve} uses the factors generated by
  {\tt \packagename\_factorize} to
  solve a system of equations with one ($\bmA \bmx = \bmb$)
  or several ($\bmA \bmX = \bmB$) right-hand sides.
  Iterative refinement may be used to improve a given solution
  or set of solutions.

\item[] {\tt \packagename\_terminate} deallocates the arrays held inside the
  structure for the factors. It should be called
  when all the systems involving its matrix have been solved
  or before another external solver is to be used.
\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% matrix formats %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmatrix
The matrix $\bmA$ may be stored in a variety of input formats.

\subsubsection{Sparse co-ordinate storage format}\label{coordinate}
Only the nonzero entries of the lower-triangular part of $\bmA$ are stored.
For the $l$-th entry of the lower-triangular portion of $\bmA$,
its row index $i$, column index $j$ and value $a_{ij}$
are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer arrays {\tt row},
{\tt col} and real array {\tt val}, respectively.
The order is unimportant, but the total number of entries
{\tt ne} is also required.

\subsubsection{Sparse row-wise storage format}\label{rowwise}
Again only the nonzero entries of the lower-triangular part are stored,
but this time they are ordered so that those in row $i$ appear directly
before those in row $i+1$. For the $i$-th row of $\bmA$, the $i$-th component
of an integer array {\tt ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while {\tt ptr} $(m+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices $j$ and values $a_{ij}$ of the entries in the $i$-th row
are stored in components
$l =$ {\tt ptr}$(i)$, \ldots ,{\tt ptr} $(i+1)-1$ of the
integer array {\tt col}, and real array {\tt val}, respectively.

For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
its predecessor.

\subsubsection{Dense storage format}\label{dense}
The matrix $\bmA$ is stored as a compact
dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
Since $\bmA$ is symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
$a_{ij}$ for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$) need be held, and this part will be
stored by rows, that is component
$i \ast (i-1)/2 + j$ of the storage array {\tt val}
will hold the value $a_{ij}$ (and, by symmetry, $a_{ji}$)
for $1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$.

%\subsubsection{Diagonal storage format}\label{diagonal}
%If $\bmA$ is diagonal (i.e., $a_{ij} = 0$ for all $1 \leq i \neq j \leq n$)
%only the diagonals entries $a_{ii}$, $1 \leq i \leq n$,  need be stored,
%and the first $n$ components of the array {\tt A\%val} may be used for
%the purpose.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% derived types %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galtypes
Five derived data types are used by the package.

%%%%%%%%%%% problem type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding the matrix}\label{typeprob}
The derived data type {\tt SMT\_type} is used to hold the matrix $\bmA$.
The components of {\tt SMT\_type} used are:

\begin{description}

\ittf{n} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that holds
the order $n$ of the matrix  $\bmA$.
\restriction {\tt n} $\geq$ {\tt 1}.

\itt{type} is an allocatable array of rank one and type default \character, that
indicates the storage scheme used. If the
sparse co-ordinate scheme (see \S\ref{coordinate}) is used
the first ten components of {\tt type} must contain the
string {\tt COORDINATE}.
For the sparse row-wise storage scheme (see \S\ref{rowwise}),
the first fourteen components of {\tt type} must contain the
string {\tt SPARSE\_BY\_ROWS}, and
for dense storage scheme (see \S\ref{dense})
the first five components of {\tt type} must contain the
string {\tt DENSE}.
%and for the diagonal storage scheme (see \S\ref{diagonal}),
%the first eight components of {\tt type} must contain the
%string {\tt DIAGONAL}.

For convenience, the procedure {\tt SMT\_put}
may be used to allocate sufficient space and insert the required keyword
into {\tt type}.
For example, if $\bmA$ is to be stored in the structure {\tt A}
of derived type {\tt SMT\_type} and we wish to use
the co-ordinate scheme, we may simply
%\vspace*{-2mm}
{\tt
\begin{verbatim}
        CALL SMT_put( A%type, 'COORDINATE', istat )
\end{verbatim}
}
%\vspace*{-4mm}
\noindent
See the documentation for the \galahad\ package {\tt SMT}
for further details on the use of {\tt SMT\_put}.

\itt{ne} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that
holds the number of entries in the {\bf lower triangular} part of $\bmA$
in the sparse co-ordinate storage scheme (see \S\ref{coordinate}).
It need not be set for any of the other three schemes.

\itt{val} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \realdp, that holds
the values of the entries of the {\bf lower triangular} part
of the matrix $\bmA$ for each of the
storage schemes discussed in \S\ref{galmatrix}.
Any duplicated entries that appear in the sparse
co-ordinate or row-wise schemes will be summed.

\itt{row} is a rank-one allocatable array of type \integer,
that holds the row indices of the {\bf lower triangular} part of $\bmA$
in the sparse co-ordinate storage
scheme (see \S\ref{coordinate}).
It need not be allocated for any of the other schemes.
Any entry whose row index lies out of the range $[$1,n$]$ will be ignored.

\itt{col} is a rank-one allocatable array variable of type \integer,
that holds the column indices of the {\bf lower triangular} part of
$\bmA$ in either the sparse co-ordinate
(see \S\ref{coordinate}), or the sparse row-wise
(see \S\ref{rowwise}) storage scheme.
It need not be allocated when the dense
%or diagonal storage schemes are used.
storage scheme is used.
Any entry whose column index lies out of the range $[$1,n$]$ will be ignored,
while the row and column indices of any entry from the
{\bf strict upper triangle} will implicitly be swapped.

\itt{ptr} is a rank-one allocatable array of size {\tt n+1} and type
\integer, that holds the starting position of
each row of the {\bf lower triangular} part of $\bmA$, as well
as the total number of entries plus one, in the sparse row-wise storage
scheme (see \S\ref{rowwise}). It need not be allocated for the
other schemes.

\end{description}
Although any of the above-mentioned matrix storage formats may be used
with each supported solver, {\tt MA27/SILS} and {\tt HSL\_MA57}
from HSL are most efficient if co-ordinate input is provided.

%%%%%%%%%%% control type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding control
 parameters}\label{typecontrol}
The derived data type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
is used to hold controlling data.
Default values specifically for the desired solver
may be obtained by calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
(see \S\ref{subinit}),
%Default values are assigned,
while components may be changed at run time by calling
{\tt \packagename\_read\-\_specfile}
(see \S\ref{readspec}).
The components of
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
are:

\begin{description}

\itt{print\_level\_solver} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that is used
to control the amount of informational output that is required by the exteral
solver. No
informational output will occur if ${\tt print\_level} \leq {\tt 0}$. If
{\tt print\_level} $\geq$ {\tt 1} the amount of output produced is solver
dependent.
The default is {\tt print\_level\_solver = 0}.

\itt{bits} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that indicates the machine architecture being used.
It should be set to {\tt 32} on a  32-bit architecture and to {\tt 64}
on a 64-bit architecture. The default value is {\tt 32},
and this default is used if {\tt bits} $\neq$ {\tt 64}.

\itt{block\_size\_kernel} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that gives the target block size for the kernel factorization, if any.
The default value is {\tt 40},
and this default is used if {\tt block\_size\_kernel < 1}.

\itt{block\_size\_elimination} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that gives the target block size for parallel factorization, if any.
The default is {\tt block\_size\_elimination = 32},
and this default is used if {\tt block\_size\_\-elimination < 1}.

\itt{blas\_block\_size\_solve} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that gives the block size for level-two and -three basic linear algebra
subprograms (BLAS) in the solution phase.
The default is {\tt blas\_block\_size\_solve = 16},
and this default is used if {\tt blas\_block\_size\_solve < 1}.

\itt{node\_amalgamation} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that controls node amalgamation. Two neighbours in the elimination tree are
merged if they both involve fewer than {\tt node\_amalgamation} eliminations.
The default is {\tt node\_amalgamation$=$32}, and this default is used
if {\tt node\_amalgamation < 1}.

\itt{initial\_pool\_size} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that holds the initial size of the arrays that store the task pool for
parallel factorization, if any.
The default is {\tt initial\_pool\_size = 100000},
and this default is used if {\tt initial\_pool\_size < 1}.

\itt{min\_real\_factor\_size} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that specifies the amount of real storage that will initially be
allocated for the factors and other data.
The default is {\tt min\_real\_factor\_size = 10000},
and this default is used if {\tt min\_real\_factor\_size < 1}.

\itt{min\_integer\_factor\_size} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that specifies the amount of integer storage that will initially be
allocated for the factors and other data.
The default is {\tt min\_integer\_factor\_size = 10000},
and this default is used if {\tt min\_integer\_factor\_size < 1}.

\itt{max\_real\_factor\_size} is a scalar variable of type \longinteger,
that specifies the maximum amount of real storage that will be
allocated for the factors and other data.
The default is {\tt max\_real\_factor\_size = HUGE(0)}.

\itt{max\_integer\_factor\_size} is a scalar variable of type \longinteger,
that specifies the maximum amount of integer storage that will be
allocated for the factors and other data.
The default is {\tt max\_integer\_factor\_size = HUGE(0)}.

\itt{max\_in\_core\_store} is a scalar variable of type \longinteger,
that specifies the maximum amount of storage (measured in Fortran storage units)
to be used if the user wants to use in-core arrays when possible in place of
out-of-core direct-access files for solvers that support out-of-core
factorization. If {\tt max\_in\_core\_store = 0}, factorization will
occur entirely out-of-core.
The default is {\tt max\_in\_core\_store = HUGE(0)/4}
({\tt HUGE(0)/8} in {\tt \fullpackagename\-\_\-double})
for 32-bit architectures and
{\tt max\_in\_core\_store = HUGE(0\_long)/4}
({\tt HUGE(0\_long)/8}
in {\tt \fullpackagename\-\_\-double})
in the 64-bit case.

\itt{array\_increase\_factor} is a scalar variable of type \realdp, that holds
the factor by which arrays sizes are to be increased if they are too small.
The default is {\tt array\_increase\_factor = 2.0}.

\itt{array\_decrease\_factor} is a scalar variable of type \realdp, that holds
a factor that is used to assess whether previously allocated internal
workspace arrays are excessive. In particular, if current requirements are
less than {\tt array\_decrease\_factor} times the currently allocated space,
the space will be re-allocated to current requirements.
The default is {\tt array\_decrease\_factor = 2.0}.

\itt{pivot\_control} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that is used to control numerical pivoting by {\tt \packagename\_\-factorize}.
Possible values are:
\begin{description}
 \itt{1}  Numerical pivoting will be performed, with relative pivot
     tolerance given by the component {\tt relative\_\-pivot\_tolerance}.
 \itt{2}  No pivoting will be performed and an error exit will occur
     immediately a sign change is detected among the pivots. This is
     suitable for cases when $\bmA$  is thought to be definite and is likely to
     decrease the factorization time while still providing a stable
     decomposition.
 \itt{3}  No pivoting will be performed and an error exit will occur if a
     zero pivot is detected. This is likely to decrease the factorization
     time, but may be unstable if there is a sign change among the pivots
     or a tiny pivot is encountered.
 \itt{4}  No pivoting will be performed but the matrix will be altered
     to ensure that the result is ``sufficiently'' positive definite
     if a non-positive pivot is encountered.
\end{description}
The default is {\tt pivot\_control = 1}, and any value outside of
$[${\tt1,4}$]$ will be reset to the default.

\itt{ordering} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that
controls the initial order of the rows when performing the factorization.
This will be ignored if an explicit permutation is specified (see the
argument {\tt PERM} for {\tt \packagename\_analyse}).
Possible values are:
\begin{description}
\itt{$<$ 0} The ordering will be chosen by the specified solver with its
        own ordering-selection value {\tt - ordering}.
\itt{0} The ordering will be chosen to be the default for the solver used.
        If the specified solver has no default, the rows will be unordered
        which is unlikely to be satisfactory.
\itt{1} The ordering will be chosen by the Approximate Minimum Degree method
       with provisions for ``dense'' rows/columns.
\itt{2} The ordering will be chosen by the Minimum Degree method.
\itt{3} The ordering will be chosen by the Nested Dissection method; this
 requires the user to have installed the external package {\tt METIS}.
\itt{4} An indefinite ordering involving a combination of 1x1 and 2x2 pivots
       will be used.
% , that is optionally required by {\tt HSL\_MA57} and {\tt PARDISO}.
\itt{5} An ordering that aims to provide a small profile or wavefront
       will be used.
\itt{6} An ordering that aims to provide a small bandwidth will be used.
\itt{7} The ordering will be chosen by an earlier implementation of 
        the Approximate Minimum Degree method with no provisions 
        for ``dense'' rows/columns.
\itt{$>$ 7} The ordering will be chosen automatically depending on matrix
       characteristics (not yet implemented).
\end{description}
Values {\tt 1} to {\tt 4} are only supported if the HSL package {\tt HSL\_MC68}
is available, while {\tt 5} and {\tt 6} are only possible
when the HSL package {\tt MC61} is provided.
The default is {\tt ordering = 0}, and currently any value $>$ {\tt 6} will
be reset to this default.

\itt{full\_row\_threshold} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that controls the threshold for detecting rows with a large percentage
(relative to the matrix order) of nonzeros by {\tt \packagename\_analyse}.
Such rows will normally be ordered last when the factorization occurs.
If {\tt full\_row\_threshold = 100}, only fully dense
rows will be detected.
The default is {\tt full\_row\_threshold = 100},
and any value outside of $[${\tt 0,100}$]$ will be reset to the default.

\itt{row\_search\_indefinite} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that controls the maximum number of rows searched for a pivot when using the
indefinite ordering (see {\tt ordering = 4} above).
The default is {\tt row\_search\_\-indefinite = 10},
and this default is used if {\tt row\_search\_\-indefinite < 1}.

\itt{scaling} is a scalar variable of type \integer, that may control
scaling of the matrix.
Possible values are:
\begin{description}
\itt{$<$ 0} The scaling will be chosen by the specified solver with its
        own scaling-selection value {\tt - scaling}.
\itt{0} No scaling is used.
\itt{1} Scale the matrix so that the diagonal and off diagonal
entries of the result are one and smaller than one, respectively,
in absolute value using the package {\tt HSL\_MC64}.
\itt{2} Scale the matrix so that $\ell_1$-norms of each column
of the result are approximately one using the package {\tt MC77}.
\itt{3} Scale the matrix so that $\ell_{\infty}$-norms of each column
of the result are approximately one using the package {\tt MC77}.
\itt{4} Use the default for the specified solver, or {\tt 0} 
(no scaling) if there is no default.
\end{description}
This option is not currently available for all solvers; {\tt -1} is
only available for {\tt HSL\_MA57}, {\tt -2} for {\tt HSL\_MA77}
and {\tt -3} to {\tt -1} for {\tt HSL\_MA97}.
The default is {\tt scaling = 0},
and any value larger than {\tt 4} will be reset to the default.

\itt{scale\_maxit} is a scalar variable of type \integer,
that controls the maximum number of iterations performed
by {\tt MC77} when scaling is requested (see {\tt scale} above).
The default is {\tt scale\_maxit = 10},
and this default is used if {\tt scale\_maxit < 1}.

\itt{scale\_thresh} is a scalar variable of type \realdp,
that is used by {\tt MC77} to terminate the scaling iteration.
The iteration stops as soon as the the difference between
every column norm and one is smaller that {\tt scale\_thresh}
in magnitude. The default is {\tt scale\_thresh = 0.1}.

\itt{relative\_pivot\_tolerance} is a scalar variable of type \realdp,
that holds the relative pivot tolerance that is used to control the
stability of the factorization of indefinite $\bmA$.
The default is {\tt relative\_pivot\_tolerance = 0.01}.
For problems requiring greater
than average numerical care a higher value than the default would be
advisable. Values greater than {\tt 0}.{\tt 5} are treated as {\tt 0}.{\tt 5}
for all solvers except {\tt HSL\_MA77} (where an upper bound {\tt 1.0} is
enforced) and less than {\tt 0}.{\tt 0} as {\tt 0}.{\tt 0}.

\itt{minimum\_pivot\_tolerance} is a scalar variable of type \realdp,
that holds the minimum permitted value of the relative pivot tolerance.
If, at any stage of the computation, fewer than the
expected number of stable pivots have been found using
the current tolerance but the largest
candidate pivot would be acceptable with tolerance
{\tt minimum\_pivot\_tolerance}, the pivot is accepted, and all
subsequent pivots will be assessed relative to
{\tt minimum\_pivot\_tolerance} rather than
{\tt relative\_pivot\_tolerance}.
The default is {\tt minimum\_pivot\_tolerance$=$0.01}.
Values of {\tt minimum\_pivot\_tolerance} greater than
{\tt relative\_pivot\_\-tolerance} are treated as
{\tt relative\_pivot\_tolerance}, while  values
less than $0$ are treated as $0$.

\itt{absolute\_pivot\_tolerance} is a scalar variable of type \realdp, that
holds the absolute pivot tolerance that is used to control the
stability of the factorization of indefinite $\bmA$.
No pivot smaller than {\tt absolute\_pivot\_tolerance} in
absolute value will be accepted.
The default is {\tt absolute\_pivot\_\-tolerance = EPSILON(1.0)}
({\tt EPSILON(1.0D0)} in {\tt \fullpackagename\_double}).

\itt{zero\_tolerance} is a scalar variable of type \realdp, that
controls which small entries are to be ignored during the factorization
of $\bmA$. Any entry smaller in absolute value than
{\tt zero\_\-tolerance} will be treated as zero; as a consequence when
{\tt zero\_tolerance > 0}, the factors produced will be of a perturbation
of order {\tt zero\_tolerance} of $\bmA$.

pivots can be found with relative pivot tolerance greater than
{\tt minimum\_pivot\_tolerance},  diagonal entries are accepted as pivots. If
a candidate diagonal entry has absolute value

selected as a pivot; otherwise, the pivot is given the value
that has the same sign but absolute value {\tt static\_pivot\_tolerance}.

In particular, iterative refinement will cease as soon as
$\|\bmA \bmx - \bmb\|_{\infty}$ falls below
$\max (\| \bmb\|_{\infty} \ast$ {\tt acceptable\_residual\_relative},
{\tt acceptable\_residual\_absolute}$)$;
for the multiple residual case, we require that

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Further control features %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galfeatures
\noindent In this section, we describe features for enquiring about and
manipulating the parts of the factorization constructed. These features
will not be needed by a user who wants simply to solve systems of
equations with matrix $\bmA$.

The solvers used each produce an $\bmL \bmD \bmL^T$ factorization
of $\bmA$ or a perturbation thereof, where $\bmL$ is a permuted lower
triangular matrix and $\bmD$ is a block diagonal matrix with blocks of order
1 and 2. It is convenient to write this factorization in the form
\disp{\bmA + \bmE = \bmP \bmL \bmD \bmL^T \bmP^T,}
where $\bmP$ is a permutation matrix and $\bmE$ is any diagonal perturbation
introduced. The following subroutines
are provided:
\begin{description}
\ittf{} {\tt \packagename\_enquire} returns any of $\bmP$, $\bmD$, $\bmE$,
or the pivot permutations implicit in $\bmD$.

\ittf{} {\tt \packagename\_alter\_d} alters $\bmD$. Note that this means that
we no longer have a factorization of the given matrix $\bmA$.

\ittf{} {\tt \packagename\_part\_solve} solves one of the systems of equations
$\bmP \bmL \bmx =  \bmb$,
$\bmD \bmx =  \bmb$,
$\bmL^T \bmP^T \bmx =  \bmb$, or when $\bmA$ is positive definite,
$\bmP \bmL \sqrt{\bmD}\bmx =  \bmb$,
for one or more right-hand sides.

\ittf{} {\tt \packagename\_sparse\_forward\_solve} solves
$\bmP \bmL \bmx =  \bmb$ when $\bmb$ is sparse and aims to return a
sparse $\bmx$.

\ittf{} {\tt \packagename\_fredholm\_alternative} computes
the Fredholm alternative for the data $(\bmA,\bmb)$, i.e., returns either
$\bmx$ satisfying $\bmA \bmx = \bmb$ or $\bmx$ satisfying
$\bmA \bmx = \bmzero$ and $\bmb^T \bmx > 0$.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Further features %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galcontrolfeatures
\noindent In this section, we describe an alternative means of setting
control parameters, that is components of the variable {\tt control} of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see \S\ref{typecontrol}),
by reading an appropriate data specification file using the
subroutine {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}. This facility
is useful as it allows a user to change  {\tt \packagename} control parameters
without editing and recompiling programs that call {\tt \packagename}.

A specification file, or specfile, is a data file containing a number of
``specification commands''. Each command occurs on a separate line,
and comprises a ``keyword'',
that is a string (in a close-to-natural language) used to identify a
control parameter, and
an (optional) "value", which defines the value to be assigned to the given
control parameter. All keywords and values are case insensitive,
keywords may be preceded by one or more blanks but
values must not contain blanks, and
each value must be separated from its keyword by at least one blank.
Values must not contain more than 30 characters, and
each line of the specification file is limited to 80 characters,
including the blanks separating keyword and value.

The portion of the specification file used by
{\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
must start
with a ``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' command and end with an
``{\tt END}'' command.  The syntax of the specfile is thus defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
  ( .. lines ignored by SLS_read_specfile .. )
    BEGIN SLS
       keyword    value
       .......    .....
       keyword    value
    END
  ( .. lines ignored by SLS_read_specfile .. )
\end{verbatim}
where keyword and value are two strings separated by (at least) one blank.
The ``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiter command lines
may contain additional (trailing) strings so long as such strings are
separated by one or more blanks, so that lines such as
\begin{verbatim}
    BEGIN SLS SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
    END SLS SPECIFICATION
\end{verbatim}
are acceptable. Furthermore,
between the
``{\tt BEGIN \packagename}'' and ``{\tt END}'' delimiters,
specification commands may occur in any order.  Blank lines and
lines whose first non-blank character is {\tt !} or {\tt *} are ignored.
The content
of a line after a {\tt !} or {\tt *} character is also
ignored (as is the {\tt !} or {\tt *}
character itself). This provides an easy way to ``comment out'' some
specification commands, or to comment specific values
of certain control parameters.

The value of a control parameter may be of three different types, namely
integer, character or real.
Integer and real values may be expressed in any relevant Fortran integer and
floating-point formats (respectively).
%Permitted values for logical
%parameters are "{\tt ON}", "{\tt TRUE}", "{\tt .TRUE.}", "{\tt T}",
%"{\tt YES}", "{\tt Y}", or "{\tt OFF}", "{\tt NO}",
%"{\tt N}", "{\tt FALSE}", "{\tt .FALSE.}" and "{\tt F}".
%Empty values are also allowed for
%logical control parameters, and are interpreted as "{\tt TRUE}".

The specification file must be open for
input when {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}
is called, and the associated unit number
passed to the routine in {\tt device} (see below).
Note that the corresponding
file is rewound, which makes it possible to combine the specifications
for more than one program/routine.  For the same reason, the file is not
closed by {\tt \packagename\_read\_specfile}.

\subsubsection{To read control parameters from a specification file}
\label{readspec}

Control parameters may be read from a file as follows:
\hskip0.5in

\def\baselinestretch{0.8}
{\tt
\begin{verbatim}
     CALL SLS_read_specfile( control, device )
\end{verbatim}
}
\def\baselinestretch{1.0}

\begin{description}
\itt{control} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see \S\ref{typecontrol}).
Default values should have already been set, perhaps by calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.

\itt{device} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type \integer,
that must be set to the unit number on which the specification file
has been opened. If {\tt device} is not open, {\tt control} will
not be altered and execution will continue, but an error message
will be printed on unit {\tt control\%error}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galexample
We illustrate the use of the package on the solution of the
single set of equations
\disp{\mat{ccccc}{ 2 & 3 &   &   &   \\
                   3 &   & 4 &   & 6 \\
                     & 4 & 1 & 5 &   \\
                     &   & 5 &   &   \\
                     & 6 & &     & 1 } \bmx =
       \vect{ 8 \\ 45 \\ 31 \\ 15 \\ 17}}
(Note that this example does not illustrate all the facilities).
Then, choosing the solver {\tt SILS}, we may use the following code:

{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageexample}
}
\noindent
%with the following data
%{\tt \small
%\VerbatimInput{\packagedata}
%}
%\noindent
This produces the following output:
{\tt \small
\VerbatimInput{\packageresults}
}
\noindent
The same problem may be solved holding the data in
a sparse row-wise storage format by replacing the lines
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
! allocate and set lower triangle of matrix in co-ordinate form
...
! problem setup complete
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
by
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
! allocate and set lower triangle of matrix in spares row form
     CALL SMT_put( matrix%type, 'SPARSE_BY_ROWS', s )
     matrix%n = n 
     ALLOCATE( matrix%val( ne ), matrix%col( ne ), matrix%ptr( n + 1 ) )
     matrix%ptr = (/ 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 /)
     matrix%col = (/ 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 5 /)
     matrix%val = (/ 2.0_wp, 3.0_wp, 4.0_wp, 1.0_wp, 5.0_wp, 6.0_wp, 1.0_wp /)
! problem setup complete
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
or using a dense storage format with the replacement lines
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
! allocate and set lower triangle of matrix in dense form
     CALL SMT_put( matrix%type, 'DENSE', s )
     matrix%n = n 
     ALLOCATE( matrix%val( n * ( n + 1 ) / 2 ) )
     matrix%val = (/ 2.0_wp, 3.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 4.0_wp, 1.0_wp,           &
                     0.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 5.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 6.0_wp,           &
                     0.0_wp, 0.0_wp, 1.0_wp /)
! problem setup complete
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent
respectively.
