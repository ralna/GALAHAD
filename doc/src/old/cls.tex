%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUMMARY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galsummary
This package uses an primal-dual interior-point method
to solve the {\bf constrained least distance problem}
\disp{\mbox{minimize}\;\; \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2
 ( x_{i}^{ } - x_{i}^{0} )^{2}}}
subject to the general linear constraints
\disp{c_{i}^{l}  \leq  \bma_{i}^{T}\bmx  \leq  c_{i}^{u}, \;\;\;
 i = 1, \ldots , m,}
and the simple bound constraints
\disp{x_{j}^{l}  \leq  x_{j}^{ } \leq  x_{j}^{u} , \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots , n,}
where the vectors $\bmw$, $\bmx^{0}$,
$\bma_{i}$, $\bmc^{l}$, $\bmc^{u}$, $\bmx^{l}$,
and $\bmx^{u}$ are given.
Full advantage is taken of any zero coefficients in the
vectors $\bma_{i}$.
Any of the constraint bounds $c_{i}^{l}$, $c_{i}^{u}$,
$x_{j}^{l}$ and $x_{j}^{u}$ may be infinite.
In the special case where $\bmw = 0$, the so-called
analytic center of the feasible set will be found.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOW TO USE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galhowto

%\subsection{Calling sequences}

Access to the package requires a {\tt USE} statement such as

\medskip\noindent{\em Single precision version}

\hspace{8mm} {\tt USE \fullpackagename\_single}

\medskip\noindent{\em Double precision version}

\hspace{8mm} {\tt USE  \fullpackagename\_double}

\medskip

\noindent
If it is required to use both modules at the same time, the derived types
{\tt SMT\_type},
{\tt QPT\_problem\_type},
{\tt \packagename\_time\_type},
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type},
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
and
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
(Section~\ref{galtypes})
and the subroutines
{\tt \packagename\_initialize},
{\tt \packagename\_\-solve}
and
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}
(Section~\ref{galarguments})
must be renamed on one of the {\tt USE} statements.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% matrix formats %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmatrix
The constraint Jacobian $\bmA$, that is, the matrix
whose rows are the vectors $\bma_{i}^{T}$, $i = 1, \ldots , m$,
may be stored in one of three input formats.

\subsubsection{Dense storage format}\label{dense}
The matrix is stored as a compact
dense matrix by rows, that is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
Component $n \ast (i-1) + j$ of the storage array {\tt A\_val} will hold the
value $a_{ij}$ for $i = 1, \ldots , m$, $j = 1, \ldots , n$.

\subsubsection{Sparse co-ordinate storage format}\label{coordinate}
Only the nonzero entries of the matrix are stored. For the
$l$-th entry of $\bmA$, its row index $i$, column index $j$
and value $a_{ij}$
are stored in the $l$-th components of the integer arrays {\tt A\_row},
{\tt A\_col} and real array {\tt A\_val}.
The order is unimportant, but the total
number of entries {\tt A\_ne} is also required.

\subsubsection{Sparse row-wise storage format}\label{rowwise}
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in row $i$ appear directly before those
in row $i+1$. For the $i$-th row of $\bmA$, the $i$-th component of a
integer array {\tt A\_ptr} holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while {\tt A\_ptr} $(m+1)$ holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices $j$ and values $a_{ij}$ of the entries in the $i$-th row
are stored in components
$l =$ {\tt A\_ptr}$(i)$, \ldots ,{\tt A\_ptr} $(i+1)-1$ of the
integer array {\tt A\_col}, and real array {\tt A\_val}, respectively.

For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
its predecessor.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% derived types %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galtypes
Five derived data types are accessible from the package.

%%%%%%%%%%% problem type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding the problem}\label{typeprob}
The derived data type {\tt QPT\_problem\_type} is used to hold
the problem. The components of
{\tt QPT\_problem\_type}
are:

\begin{description}

\itt{new\_problem\_structure} is a scalar variable of type default \logical,
 that is \true\ if this is the first (or only) problem in a sequence of
 problems with identical "structure" to be attempted, and \false\ if
 a previous problem with the same "structure" (but different
 numerical data) has been solved. Here, the term "structure" refers both to
 the sparsity patterns of the Jacobian matrices $\bmA$ involved
 (but not their numerical values), to the zero/nonzero/infinity patterns
 (a bound is either zero, $\pm$ infinity, or a finite but arbitrary
 nonzero) of each of the constraint bounds, and to the variables and constraints
 that are fixed (both bounds are the same) or free (the lower and upper
 bounds are $\pm$ infinity, respectively).

\ittf{n} is a scalar variable of type default \integer,
 that holds the number of optimization variables, $n$.

\ittf{m} is a scalar variable of type default \integer,
 that holds the number of general linear constraints, $m$.

\itt{weight\_type} is a scalar variable of type default \integer,
that is used to indicate whether the weights $\bmw$
have special or general values. Possible values for {\tt weight\_type} are:
\begin{description}
\itt{0}  In this case, $\bmw = 0$, and an approximation to the
  analytic center will be computed.

\itt{1} In this case, $w_{i} = 1$ for $i = 1, \ldots ,n$.

\itt{$\neq$ 0,1} In this case, general values of $\bmw$ will be used,
     and will be provided by the user in the component {\tt WEIGHT}.
\end{description}

must be allocated to have length {\tt n}, and its $j$-th component
filled with the value $w_{i}  =  1$ for $i = 1, \ldots ,n$,
whenever {\tt weight\_type} $\neq 0, 1$.
If {\tt weight\_type} {= 0, 1}, {\tt WEIGHT} need not be allocated.

\itt{A\_val} is a rank-one pointer array of type default \realdp, that holds

two schemes, but must be allocated to be of length at least 0.

\itt{A\_col} is a rank-one pointer array variable of type default \integer,
that holds the column indices  of $\bmA$ in either the sparse co-ordinate
(see Section~\ref{coordinate}), or the sparse row-wise
(see Section~\ref{rowwise}) storage scheme.
It need not be set when the dense storage scheme is used,
but must then be allocated to be of length at least {\tt n} $\ast$ {\tt m}.

\itt{A\_ptr} is a rank-one pointer array of dimension {\tt m+1} and type
default \integer, that holds the
starting position of each row of $\bmA$, as well
as the total number of entries plus one, in the sparse row-wise storage
scheme (see Section~\ref{rowwise}). It need not be assigned values when the
other schemes are used, but must be allocated and will be used as
workspace.

\itt{A\_ne} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that is used to
indicate the storage scheme used. If the dense storage scheme
(see Section~\ref{dense}) is used, {\tt A\_ne} must be set to {\tt -2}.
For the sparse row-wise storage scheme (see Section~\ref{rowwise})
{\tt A\_ne} must be set to {\tt -1}.
For the sparse co-ordinate scheme (see Section~\ref{coordinate}),
{\tt A\_ne} must be set to the number of entries in $\bmA$.

\ittf{C\_l} is a rank-one pointer array of dimension {\tt m} and type
default \realdp, that holds the vector of lower bounds $\bmc^{l}$
on the general constraints. The $i$-th component of

where {\tt infinity} is a component of the control array {\tt control}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}).

\ittf{C\_u} is a rank-one pointer array of dimension {\tt m} and type
default \realdp, that holds the vector of upper bounds $\bmc^{u}$
on the general constraints. The $i$-th component of

default \realdp, that holds
the vector of lower bounds $\bmx^{l}$ on the the variables.
The $j$-th component of {\tt X\_l}, $j = 1, \ldots , n$,
contains $\bmx_{j}^{l}$.
Infinite bounds are allowed by setting the corresponding
components of {\tt X\_l} to any value smaller than {\tt -infinity},
where {\tt infinity} is a component of the control array {\tt control}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}).

\ittf{X\_u} is a rank-one pointer array of dimension {\tt n} and type
default \realdp, that holds
the vector of upper bounds $\bmx^{u}$ on the variables.
The $j$-th component of {\tt X\_u}, $j = 1, \ldots , n$,
contains $\bmx_{j}^{u}$.
Infinite bounds are allowed by setting the corresponding
components of {\tt X\_u} to any value larger than that {\tt infinity},
where {\tt infinity} is a component of the control array {\tt control}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}).

\ittf{X} is a rank-one pointer array of dimension {\tt n} and type
default \realdp,
that holds the values $\bmx$ of the optimization variables.

The vector $\bmx^{0}$ will initially be specified in {\tt X}.

\ittf{Z} is a rank-one pointer array of dimension {\tt n} and type default
\realdp, that holds
the values $\bmz$ of estimates  of the dual variables
corresponding to the simple bound constraints (see Section~\ref{galmethod}).

\ittf{C} is a rank-one pointer array of dimension {\tt m} and type default
\realdp, that holds
the values $\bmA \bmx$ of the constraints.
The $i$-th component of {\tt C}, $i = 1,  \ldots ,  m$, contains

default \realdp, that holds
the values $\bmy$ of estimates  of the Lagrange multipliers
corresponding to the general linear constraints (see Section~\ref{galmethod}).

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%% control type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding control
 parameters}\label{typecontrol}
The derived data type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
is used to hold controlling data. Default values may be obtained by calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
(see Section~\ref{subinit}). The components of
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
are:

\begin{description}

\itt{print\_level} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that is used
to control the amount of informational output which is required. No
informational output will occur if {\tt print\_level} $\leq 0$. If
{\tt print\_level} $= 1$, a single line of output will be produced for each
iteration of the process. If {\tt print\_level} $\geq 2$, this output will be
increased to provide significant detail of each iteration.
The default is {\tt print\_level = 0}.

\ittf{out} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that holds the
stream number for informational messages. Printing of informational messages in
{\tt \packagename\_solve} is suppressed if {\tt out} $< 0$.
The default is {\tt out = 6}.

\itt{error} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that holds the
stream number for error messages. Printing of error messages in
{\tt \packagename\_solve} and {\tt \packagename\_terminate} is suppressed if
{\tt error} $\leq 0$.
The default is {\tt error = 6}.

\itt{2} an augmented-system factorization will be used.
\end{description}
The default is {\tt factor = 0}.

\itt{max\_col} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that specifies
the maximum number of nonzeros in a column of $\bmA$ which is permitted
by the Schur-complement factorization.
The default is {\tt max\_col = 10}.

\itt{indmin} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that specifies
an initial estimate as to the amount of integer workspace required by
the factorization package {\tt SILS.
The} default is {\tt indmin = 1000}.

\itt{valmin} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that specifies
an initial estimate as to the amount of real workspace required by
the factorization package {\tt SILS.
The} default is {\tt valmin = 1000}.

\itt{itrmax} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that specifies
the maximum number of iterative refinements allowedfor each solution of
the Newton equations.
The default is {\tt itrmax = 1}.

\itt{infeas\_max} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that specifies
the number of iterations for which the overall infeasibility
of the problem is not reduced by at least a factor {\tt reduce\_infeas
before} the problem is flagged as infeasible (see {\tt reduce\_infeas}).
The default is {\tt infeas\_max = 10}.

\itt{restore\_problem} is a scalar variable of type default \integer, that
specifies how much of the input problem is to be retored on output.
Possible values are:
\begin{description}
\itt{0} nothing is restored.
\itt{1} the vector data $\bmw$,
   $\bmc^{l}$, $\bmc^{u}$, $\bmx^{l}$, and $\bmx^{u}$
   will be restored to their input values.
\itt{2} the entire problem, that is the above vector data along with
the Jacobian matrix $\bmA$, will be restored.
\end{description}
The default is {\tt restore\_problem = 0}.

\itt{infinity} is a scalar variable of type default \realdp, that is used to
specify which constraint bounds are infinite.
Any bound larger than {\tt infinity} in modulus will be regarded as infinite.
The default is {\tt infinity =} $10^{19}$.

\itt{stop\_p} is a scalar variable of type default \realdp, that holds the
required accuracy for the primal infeasibility (see Section~\ref{galmethod}).
The default is {\tt stop\_p =} $u^{1/3}$,
where $u$ is {\tt EPSILON(1.0)} ({\tt EPSILON(1.0D0)} in
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double}).

\itt{stop\_d} is a scalar variable of type default
\realdp, that holds the
required accuracy for the dual infeasibility (see Section~\ref{galmethod}).
The default is {\tt stop\_d =} $u^{1/3}$,

required accuracy for the violation of complementarity slackness
(see Section~\ref{galmethod}).

where $u$ is {\tt EPSILON(1.0)} ({\tt EPSILON(1.0D0)} in
{\tt \fullpackagename\_double}).

\itt{prfeas} is a scalar variable of type default \realdp, that aims to specify
the closest that any initial variable may be to infeasibility. Any variable
closer to infeasibility than {\tt prfeas} will be moved to {\tt prfeas}
from the offending bound. However, if a variable is range bounded, and its
bounds are closer than {\tt prfeas} apart, it will be moved to the
mid-point of the two bounds.
The default is {\tt prfeas = 1.0}.

\itt{dufeas} is a scalar variable of type default \realdp, that aims to specify
the closest that any initial dual variable or Lagrange multiplier may be to
infeasibility. Any variable closer to infeasibility than {\tt prfeas} will be
moved to {\tt dufeas} from the offending bound. However, if a dual variable
is range bounded, and its bounds are closer than {\tt dufeas} apart, it will
be moved to the mid-point of the two bounds.
The default is {\tt dufeas = 1.0}.

\itt{muzero}  is a scalar variable of type default \realdp, that holds the
initial value of the barrier parameter. If {\tt muzero} is
not positive, it will be reset automatically to an appropriate value.
The default is {\tt muzero = -1.0}.

\itt{reduce\_infeas}  is a scalar variable of type default
\realdp, that specifies the
least factor by which the overall infeasibility of the problem must be reduced,
over {\tt infeas\_max} consecutive iterations,
for it not be declared infeasible (see {\tt infeas\_max)}.
The default is {\tt reduce\_infeas = 0.99}.

\itt{potential\_unbounded}  is a scalar variable of type default
\realdp, that specifies smallest
value of the potential function divided by the number of one-sided variable and
constraint bounds that will be tolerated before the analytic center is
declared to be unbounded.
The default is {\tt potential\_u\-nbounded = -10.0}.

\itt{pivot\_tol}  is a scalar variable of type default
\realdp, that holds the
threshold pivot tolerance used by the matrix factorization.  See
the documentation for the package {\tt SILS} for details.
The default is {\tt pivot\_tol = 0.01}.

\itt{pivot\_tol\_for\_dependencies} is a scalar variable of type default
\realdp, that holds the
threshold pivot  tolerance used by the matrix factorization when
attempting to detect linearly dependent constraints. A value larger
than  {\tt pivot\_tol} is appropriate. See
the documentation for the package {\tt SILS} for details.
The default is {\tt pivot\_tol\_for\_dependencies = 0.5}.

\itt{zero\_pivot} is a scalar variable of type default \realdp.
Any pivots smaller than  {\tt zero\_pivot} in absolute value will be regarded
to be zero when attempting to detect linearly dependent constraints.
The default is {\tt zero\_pivot =} $u^{3/4}$,
where $u$ is {\tt EPSILON(1.0)} ({\tt EPSILON(1.0D0)} in
{\tt \fullpackagename\_dou\-ble}).

\itt{remove\_dependencies} is a scalar variable of type
default \logical, that must be set \true\ if the algorithm
is to attempt to remove any linearly dependent constraints before
solving the problem, and \false\ otherwise.
We recommend removing linearly dependencies.
The default is {\tt remove\_dependencies = .TRUE.}.

\itt{treat\_zero\_bounds\_as\_general} is a scalar variable of type
default \logical.
If it is set to \false, variables which
are only bounded on one side, and whose bound is zero,
will be recognised as non-negativities/non-positivities rather than simply as
lower- or upper-bounded variables.
If it is set to \true, any variable bound
$x_{j}^{l}$ or $x_{j}^{u}$ which has the value 0.0 will be
treated as if it had a general value.
Setting {\tt treat\_zero\_bounds\_as\_general} to \true\ has the advantage
that if a sequence of problems are reordered, then bounds which are
``accidentally'' zero will be considered to have the same structure as
those which are nonzero. However, {\tt \fullpackagename} is
able to take special advantage of non-negativities/non-positivities, so
if a single problem, or if a sequence of problems whose
bound structure is known not to change, is/are to be solved,
it will pay to set the variable to \false.
The default is {\tt treat\_zero\_bounds\_as\_general = .FALSE.}.

\itt{just\_feasible} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
must be set \true\ if the algorithm should stop as soon as a feasible point
of the constraint set is found, and \false\ otherwise.
%We recommend using the analytic center.
The default is {\tt just\_feasible = .FALSE.}.

\itt{getdua} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
must be set \true\ if the user-provided estimates of the dual variables
should be replaced by estimates whose aim is to try to balance the
requirements of dual feasibility and complementary slackness,
and \false\ if users estimates are to be used.
The default is {\tt getdua = .FALSE.}.

\itt{feasol} is a scalar variable of type default \logical, that
should be set \true\
if the final solution obtained will be perturbed
so that variables close to their bounds are moved onto these bounds,
and \false\ otherwise.
The default is {\tt feasol = .TRUE.}.

\end{description}

total number of backtracks performed during the sequence of linesearches.

\ittf{obj} is a scalar variable of type default \realdp, that holds the

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%% data type %%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The derived data type for holding problem data}\label{typedata}
The derived data type
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
is used to hold all the data for a particular problem,
or sequences of problems with the same structure, between calls of
{\tt \packagename} procedures.
This data should be preserved, untouched, from the initial call to
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}
to the final call to
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% argument lists %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galarguments
There are three procedures for user calls:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_initialize}
      is used to set default values, and initialize private data,
      before solving one or more problems with the
      same sparsity and bound structure.
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_solve}
      is called to solve the problem.
\item The subroutine
      {\tt \packagename\_terminate}
      is provided to allow the user to automatically deallocate array
       components of the private data, allocated by
       {\tt \packagename\_solve},
       at the end of the solution process.
       It is important to do this if the data object is re-used for another
       problem {\bf with a different structure}
       since {\tt \packagename\_initialize} cannot test for this situation,
       and any existing associated targets will subsequently become unreachable.
\end{enumerate}
%We use square brackets {\tt [ ]} to indicate \optional arguments.

%%%%%% initialization subroutine %%%%%%

\subsubsection{The initialization subroutine}\label{subinit}
 Default values are provided as follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_initialize( data, control )}

\vspace*{-3mm}
\begin{description}

\itt{data} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typedata}). It is used to hold data about the problem being
solved. {\tt \packagename\_initialize} will ensure that all components
that are pointer arrays are disassociated.

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}).
On exit, {\tt control} contains default values for the components as
described in Section~\ref{typecontrol}.
These values should only be changed after calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%% main solution subroutine %%%%%%

\subsubsection{The constrained least-distance problem solution subroutine}
The  constrained least-distance problem solution algorithm is called as follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_solve( p, data, control, info )}

\vspace*{-3mm}
\begin{description}
\ittf{p} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type
{\tt QPT\_problem\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typeprob}).
It is used to hold data about the problem being solved.
For a new problem, the user must allocate all the array components,
and set values for all components except {\tt p\%C}.
{\tt p\%new\_problem\_structure} must be set \true, but will have been reset
to \false\ on exit from {\tt \packagename\_solve}.
Users are free to choose whichever
of the three matrix formats described in Section~\ref{galmatrix}
is appropriate for $\bmA$ for their application.

For a problem with the same structure as one that has just been
solved, the user may set {\tt p\%new\_problem\_str\-u\-cture} to \false,
so long as {\tt \packagename\_terminate} has not been called in the interim.
The \integer components must be unaltered since the
previous call to {\tt \packagename\_solve}, but the \realdp\
may be altered to reflect the new problem.

The components {\tt p\%X}, {\tt p\%Y} and {\tt p\%Z}
must be set to initial estimates, $\bmx^{0}$, of the primal variables,
$\bmx$, Lagrange multipliers for the general constraints, $\bmy$,
and dual variables for the bound constraints, $\bmz$, respectively.
Inappropriate initial values will be altered, so the user should
not be overly concerned if suitable values are not apparent, and may be
content with merely setting {\tt p\%X=0.0},
{\tt p\%Y=0.0} and {\tt p\%Z=0.0}.
The component {\tt p\%C} need not be set on entry.

On exit, the components {\tt p\%X}, {\tt p\%Y}, {\tt p\%Z} and {\tt p\%C}
will contain the best estimates of the primal variables $\bmx$,
Lagrange multipliers for the general
constraints $\bmy$, dual variables for the bound constraints $\bmz$,
and values of the constraints $\bmA \bmx$ respectively.
What of the remaining problem data has been restored depends upon
the input value of the control parameter {\tt control\%restore\_problem}.
The return format for a restored array component will be the same as its
input format.
\restrictions {\tt p\%n} $> 0$, {\tt p\%m} $\geq 0$ and {\tt p\%A\_ne}
              $\geq -2$.

\itt{data} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typedata}). It is used to hold data about the problem being
solved. It must not have been altered {\bf by the user} since the last call to
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typecontrol}). Default values may be assigned by calling
{\tt \packagename\_initialize} prior to the first call to
{\tt \packagename\_solve}.

\itt{info} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type {\tt \packagename\_type}
(see Section~\ref{typeinform}). A successful call to
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
is indicated when the  component {\tt status} has the value 0.
For other return values of {\tt status}, see Section~\ref{galerrors}.

%\itt{v} is an \optional rank-one \intentin\ pointer array of type
% default \realdp,  that holds \ldots

%%%%%%% termination subroutine %%%%%%

\subsubsection{The  termination subroutine}
All previously allocated arrays are deallocated as follows:
\vspace*{1mm}

\hspace{8mm}
{\tt CALL \packagename\_terminate( data, control, info )}

\vspace*{-3mm}
\begin{description}

\itt{data} is a scalar \intentinout\ argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_data\_type}
exactly as for
{\tt \packagename\_solve},
which must not have been altered {\bf by the user} since the last call to
{\tt \packagename\_initialize}.
On exit, array components will have been deallocated.

\itt{control} is a scalar \intentin\ argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_control\_type}
exactly as for
{\tt \packagename\_solve}.

\itt{info} is a scalar \intentout\ argument of type
{\tt \packagename\_inform\_type}
exactly as for
{\tt \packagename\_solve}.
Only the component {\tt status} will be set on exit, and a
successful call to
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}
is indicated when this  component {\tt status} has the value 0.
For other return values of {\tt status}, see Section~\ref{galerrors}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Warning and error messages %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galerrors
A negative value of {\tt info\%status} on exit from
{\tt \packagename\_solve}
or
{\tt \packagename\_terminate}
indicates that an error has occurred. No further calls should be made
until the error has been corrected. Possible values are:

\begin{description}

\itt{-1.} One of the restrictions {\tt p\%n} $> 0$, {\tt p\%m} $\geq  0$ or
    {\tt p\%A\_ne} $\geq -2$ has been violated.

\itt{-2.} An allocation error occured. A message indicating the offending
 array is written on unit {\tt control\%error} and the returned allocation
 status is given by the value {\tt inform\%alloc\_status}.

\itt{-3.} At least one of the arrays
 {\tt p\%A\_val}, {\tt p\%A\_row} or {\tt p\%A\_col},
 is not large enough to hold the original, or reordered, matrix $\bmA$

\itt{-4.} The analytic center appears to be unbounded.

\itt{-5.} The bound constraints are inconsistent.

\itt{-6.} The constraints appear to have no feasible point.

\itt{-7.} The factorization failed; the return status from the factorization
    package is given in the component {\tt inform\%fac\-t\-or\_status}.

\itt{-8.} The problem is so ill-conditioned that further progress is impossible.

\itt{-9.} The step is too small to make further impact.

\itt{-10.} Too many iterations have been performed. This may happen if
    {\tt control\%maxit} is too small, but may also be symptomatic of
    a badly scaled problem.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Information printed %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galinfo
If {\tt control\%print\_level} is positive, information about the progress
of the algorithm will be printed on unit {\tt control\-\%out}.
If {\tt control\%print\_level} $= 1$, a single line of output will be produced
for each iteration of the process.
This will include values of the current primal and dual infeasibility, and
violation of complementary slackness, the feasibility-phase objective value,
the current steplength, the value of the barrier parameter, the
number of backtracks in the linesearch and the elapsed CPU time in seconds.

If {\tt control\%print\_level} $\geq 2$ this
output will be increased to provide significant detail of each iteration.
This extra output includes residuals of the linear systems solved, and,
for larger values of {\tt control\%print\_level}, values of the primal and dual
variables and Lagrange multipliers.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% METHOD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galmethod
The required solution $\bmx$ necessarily satisfies
the primal optimality conditions
\eqn{4.1a}{\bmA \bmx = \bmc}
and
\eqn{4.1b}{
 \bmc^{l} \leq \bmc \leq \bmc^{u}, \;\;
\bmx^{l} \leq\bmx \leq\bmx^{u},}
the dual optimality conditions
\eqn{4.2a}{
 \bmW^{2} (\bmx -\bmx^{0}) =
 \bmA^{T} \bmy + \bmz,\;\;
 \bmy = \bmy^{l} + \bmy^{u} \tim{and}
 \bmz = \bmz^{l} + \bmz^{u} ,}
and
\eqn{4.2b}{
 \bmy^{l} \geq 0 , \;\;
 \bmy^{u} \leq 0 , \;\;
 \bmz^{l} \geq 0 \;\; \mbox{and} \;\;
 \bmz^{u} \leq 0 ,}
and the complementary slackness conditions
\eqn{4.3}{
( \bmA \bmx - \bmc^{l} )^{T} \bmy^{l} = 0  ,\;\;
( \bmA \bmx - \bmc^{u} )^{T} \bmy^{u} = 0  ,\;\;
(\bmx -\bmx^{l} )^{T} \bmz^{l} = 0   \tim{and}
(\bmx -\bmx^{u} )^{T} \bmz^{u} = 0 ,}
where the diagonal matrix $\bmW^{2}$ has diagonal entries $w_{j}^{2}$,
$j = 1, \ldots ,n$, the vectors $\bmy$ and $\bmz$ are
known as the Lagrange multipliers for
the general linear constraints, and the dual variables for the bounds,
respectively, and where the vector inequalities hold componentwise.
Primal-dual interior point methods iterate towards a point
that satisfies these conditions by ultimately aiming to satisfy
\req{4.1a}, \req{4.2a} and \req{4.3}, while ensuring that
\req{4.1b} and \req{4.2b} are
satisfied as strict inequalities at each stage.
Appropriate norms of the amounts by
which \req{4.1a}, \req{4.2a} and \req{4.3} fail to be satisfied are known as the
primal and dual infeasibility, and the violation of complementary slackness,
respectively. The fact that \req{4.1b} and \req{4.2b} are satisfied as strict
inequalities gives such methods their other title, namely
interior-point methods.

When $\bmw \neq 0$, the method aims at each stage to reduce the
overall violation of \req{4.1a}, \req{4.2a} and \req{4.3},
rather than reducing each of the terms individually. Given an estimate
$\bmv = (\bmx, \; \bmc, \; \bmy, \; \bmy^{l}, \;
\bmy^{u}, \; \bmz, \; \bmz^{l}, \; \bmz^{u})$
of the primal-dual variables, a correction
$\Delta \bmv = \Delta (\bmx, \; \bmc, \; \bmy, \; \bmy^{l},
 \; \bmy^{u} ,\;\bmz,\;\bmz^{l} ,\;\bmz^{u} )$
is obtained by solving a suitable linear system of Newton equations for the
nonlinear systems \req{4.1a}, \req{4.2a} and a parameterized perturbation of
\req{4.3}. An improved estimate $\bmv + \alpha \Delta \bmv$
is then used, where the stepsize $\alpha$
is chosen as close to 1.0 as possible while ensuring both that
\req{4.1b} and \req{4.2b} continue to hold and that the individual components
which make up the complementary slackness
\req{4.3} do not deviate too significantly
from their average value. The parameter that controls the perturbation
of \req{4.3} is ultimately driven to zero.
The Newton equations are solved  by applying the
\galahad\ matrix factorization package
{\tt GALAHAD\_SILS}, but there are options
to factorize the matrix as a whole (the so-called "augmented system"
approach), to perform a block elimination first (the "Schur-complement"
approach), or to let the method itself decide which of the two
previous options is more appropriate.
The "Schur-complement" approach is usually to be prefered when all the
weights are nonzero or when every variable is bounded (at least one side),
but may be inefficient if any of the columns of $\bmA$ is too dense.

When $\bmw = 0$, the method aims instead firstly to find an interior
primal feasible point, that is to ensure that \req{4.1a} is satisfied.
One this has been achieved, attention is switched to mninizing the
potential function
\disp{\phi (\bmx,\;\bmc) =
 - \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log ( c_{i}  -  c_{i}^{l} )
 - \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log ( c_{i}^{u}  -  c_{i} )
 - \sum_{j=1}^{n} \log ( x_{j}  -  x_{j}^{l} )
 - \sum_{j=1}^{n} \log ( x_{j}^{u}  -  x_{j} ) ,}
while ensuring that \req{4.1a} remain satisfied and that
$\bmx$ and $\bmc$ are strictly interior points for \req{4.1b}.
The global minimizer of this minimization problem is known as the
analytic center of the feasible region, and may be viewed as
a feasible point that is as far from the boundary of the constraints as
possible.
Note that terms in the above sumations corresponding to infinite bounds are
ignored, and that equality constraints are treated specially.
Appropriate "primal" Newton corrections are used to generate a sequence
of improving points converging to the analytic center, while the iteration
is stabilized by performing inesearches along these corrections with respect to
$\phi (\bmx,\;\bmc)$.

In order to make the solution as efficient as possible, the
variables and constraints are reordered internally
by the \galahad\ package {\tt GALAHAD\_QPP} prior to solution.
In particular, fixed variables, and
free (unbounded on both sides) constraints are temporarily removed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\galexample
Suppose we wish to find a point "closest" to
$\bmx^{0}  =  ( -2, 1, 3 )^{T}$
that satisfies the general linear constraints
$1 \leq  2 x_{1}  +  x_{2}  \leq  2$,
$x_{2}  +  x_{3}  =  2$, and simple bounds
$-1  \leq  x_{1}  \leq  1$ and $x_{3}  \leq  2$.
Suppose furthermore, that we wish to measure "closest" using
firstly the weights $\bmw  =  ( 0.1, 1, 2 )^{T}$
and secondly $\bmw  =  ( 1, 1, 1 )^{T}$, and that we also
wish to find the analytic center of the feasible region.
Then, on writing the data for this problem as
\disp{\bmA = \mat{ccc}{ 2 & 1 & \\ & 1 & 1},\;\;
 \bmc^{l} = \vect{ 1 \\ 2 }, \;\;
 \bmc^{u} = \vect{ 2 \\ 2 }, \;\;
\bmx^{l} = \vect{ -1 \\ - \infty \\ - \infty } \tim{and}
\bmx^{u} = \vect{ 1 \\ \infty \\ 2 } }
we may use the following code---note that we ask for high accuracy
when finding the analytic center by setting
{\tt control\%stop\_c} $= 10^{-16}$ and {\tt control\%itrmax} $= 2$:
