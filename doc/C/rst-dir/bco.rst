**Date:** |today|

**Author:** `Jaroslav Fowkes <jaroslav.fowkes@stfc.ac.uk>`_ and `Nick Gould <nick.gould@stfc.ac.uk>`_

GALAHAD [1]_ is a suite of open-source routines for large-scale continuous
optimization.  Currently there is a single package designed to find a local
minimum of a function whose variables are constrained to lie in a box.
