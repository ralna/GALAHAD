		  Possible exit are:
		  
		  * 0. The run was succesful

		  * -2. A deallocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending array is written on unit control.error and the returned allocation status and a string containing the name of the offending array are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * -3. The restrictions n > 0 and m > 0 or requirement that a type contains its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate', 'sparse_by_rows', 'diagonal', 'scaled_identity', 'identity', 'zero' or 'none' has been violated.
		  
		  * -4. The constraint bounds are inconsistent.
		  
		  * -5. The constraints appear to have no feasible point.
		  
		  * -9. The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the return status from the factorization package is given in the component inform.factor_status
		  
		  * -10. The factorization failed; the return status from the factorization package is given in the component inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * -11. The solution of a set of linear equations using factors from the factorization package failed; the return status from the factorization package is given in the component inform.factor_status.

		  * -17. The step is too small to make further impact.
