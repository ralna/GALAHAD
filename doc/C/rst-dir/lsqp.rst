introduction to function calls
------------------------------

To solve a given problem, functions from the lsqp package must be 
called in the following order:

* :ref:`lsqp_initialize <doxid-galahad__lsqp_8h_1aac395e385cae77c266ec108f21e9e8f9>` - provide default control parameters and set up initial data structures

* :ref:`lsqp_read_specfile <doxid-galahad__lsqp_8h_1a830242147779223fa2dbed69c2c0c200>` (optional) - override control values by reading replacement values from a file

* :ref:`lsqp_import <doxid-galahad__lsqp_8h_1a5b6f76c31025aa6794e81715f0362e70>` - set up problem data structures and fixed values

* :ref:`lsqp_reset_control <doxid-galahad__lsqp_8h_1a3dc0d9ed7fad6f3ea575e1a53c06c35e>` (optional) - possibly change control parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved

* :ref:`lsqp_solve_qp <doxid-galahad__lsqp_8h_1a44019540a174679eda6d46b1ddae89f8>` - solve the quadratic program

* :ref:`lsqp_information <doxid-galahad__lsqp_8h_1aa86d9f9bfe75370d90a0be244a9a23ce>` (optional) - recover information about the solution and solution process

* :ref:`lsqp_terminate <doxid-galahad__lsqp_8h_1a7a9c9d7589c1acb11f0e2a579b1d8053>` - deallocate data structures

See the :ref:`examples <doxid-index_lsqp_examples>` section for 
illustrations of use.

example calls
-------------

This is an example of how to use the package to solve a separable quadratic
program; the code is available in $GALAHAD/src/lsqp/C/lsqpt.c .
A variety of supported Hessian and constraint matrix storage formats are shown.

Notice that C-style indexing is used, and that this is flagged by setting 
``control.f_indexing`` to ``false``. The floating-point type ``rpc_``
is set in ``galahad_precision.h`` to ``double`` by default, but to ``float``
if the preprocessor variable ``SINGLE`` is defined. Similarly, the integer
type ``ipc_`` from ``galahad_precision.h`` is set to ``int`` by default, 
but to ``int64_t`` if the preprocessor variable ``INTEGER_64`` is defined.

.. include :: ../../../src/lsqp/C/lsqpt.c
   :code: C

This is the same example, but now fortran-style indexing is used;
the code is available in $GALAHAD/src/lsqp/C/lsqptf.c .

.. include :: ../../../src/lsqp/C/lsqptf.c
   :code: C
