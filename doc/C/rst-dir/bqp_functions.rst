typedefs
--------

.. index:: pair: typedef; spc_
.. _doxid-galahad__spc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef float spc_

``spc_`` is real single precision

.. index:: pair: typedef; rpc_
.. _doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef double rpc_

``rpc_`` is the real working precision used, but may be changed to ``float`` by
defining the  preprocessor variable ``SINGLE``.

.. index:: pair: typedef; ipc_
.. _doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef int ipc_

``ipc_`` is the default integer word length used, but may be changed to 
``int64_t`` by defining the  preprocessor variable ``INTEGER_64``.

		- data

		- holds private internal data

	*
		- status

		- 
		  is a scalar variable of type :ref:`ipc_<doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_>`, that gives the entry and exit status from the package.
		  
		  Possible exit values are:
		  
		  * 0. The run was successful.
		  
		  * **-1**
                    An allocation error occurred. A message indicating
                    the offending array is written on unit
                    control.error, and the returned allocation status
                    and a string containing the name of the offending
                    array are held in inform.alloc_status and

		  * **-2**
                    A deallocation error occurred. A message indicating
                    the offending array is written on unit control.error
                    and the returned allocation status and a string

                    in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc
                    respectively.
		  
		  * **-3**
                    The restriction n > 0 or requirement that a type
                    contains its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate',
                    'sparse_by_rows' or 'diagonal' has been violated.
		  
		  * **-4**
                    The simple-bound constraints are inconsistent.
		  
		  * **-9**
                    The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the
                    return status from the factorization package is
                    given in the component inform.factor_status
		  
		  * **-10**
                    The factorization failed; the return status from the
                    factorization package is given in the component
                    inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * **-11**
                    The solution of a set of linear equations using
                    factors from the factorization package failed; the
                    return status from the factorization package is
                    given in the component inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * **-16**
                    The problem is so ill-conditioned that further
                    progress is impossible.
		  
		  * **-17**
                    The step is too small to make further impact.
		  
		  * **-18**
                    Too many iterations have been performed. This may
                    happen if control.maxit is too small, but may also
                    be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
		  
		  * **-19**
                    The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen
                    if control.cpu_time_limit is too small, but may also
                    be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
		  
		  * **-20**
                    The Hessian matrix $H$ appears to be
                    indefinite. specified.
		  
		  * **-23**
                    An entry from the strict upper triangle of $H$
                    has been specified.

		  * **2**
                    The product $Hv$ of the Hessian $H$ with
                    a given output vector $v$ is required from the
                    user. The vector $v$ will be stored in v and
                    the product $Hv$ must be returned in prod, and
                    bqp_solve_reverse_h_prod re-entered with all other
                    arguments unchanged.
		  
		  * **3**
                    The product $Hv$ of the Hessian H with a given
                    output vector $v$ is required from the
                    user. Only components nz_v[nz_v_start-1:nz_v_end-1]
                    of the vector $v$ stored in v are nonzero. The
                    resulting product $Hv$ must be placed in prod,
                    and bqp_solve_reverse_h_prod re-entered with all
                    other arguments unchanged.
		  
		  * **4**
                    The product $Hv$ of the Hessian H with a given
                    output vector $v$ is required from the
                    user. Only components nz_v[nz_v_start-1:nz_v_end-1]
                    of the vector $v$ stored in v are nonzero. The
                    resulting **nonzeros** in the product $Hv$
                    must be placed in their appropriate comnponents of
                    prod, while a list of indices of the nonzeros placed
                    in nz_prod[0 :
                    nz_prod_end-1]. bqp_solve_reverse_h_prod should then
                    be re-entered with all other arguments
                    unchanged. Typically v will be very sparse (i.e.,
                    nz_p_end-nz_p_start will be small).
