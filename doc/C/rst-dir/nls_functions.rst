typedefs
--------

.. index:: pair: typedef; spc_
.. _doxid-galahad__spc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef float spc_

``spc_`` is real single precision

.. index:: pair: typedef; rpc_
.. _doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef double rpc_

``rpc_`` is the real working precision used, but may be changed to ``float`` by
defining the  preprocessor variable ``SINGLE``.

.. index:: pair: typedef; ipc_
.. _doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef int ipc_

``ipc_`` is the default integer word length used, but may be changed to 
``int64_t`` by defining the  preprocessor variable ``INTEGER_64``.

		- holds private internal data

	*
		- status

		- 
		  is a scalar variable of type :ref:`ipc_<doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_>`, that gives the entry and exit status from the package.
		  
		  On initial entry, status must be set to 1.
		  
		  Possible exit values are:
		  
		  * **0**
                    The run was successful
		  
		  * **-1**
                    An allocation error occurred. A message indicating
                    the offending array is written on unit
                    control.error, and the returned allocation status
                    and a string containing the name of the offending

		  * **-2**
                    A deallocation error occurred. A message indicating
                    the offending array is written on unit control.error
                    and the returned allocation status and a string

                    in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc
                    respectively.
		  
		  * **-3**
                    The restriction n > 0 or requirement that type
                    contains its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate',
                    'sparse_by_rows', 'diagonal' or 'absent' has been
                    violated.
		  
		  * **-9**
                    The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the
                    return status from the factorization package is
                    given in the component inform.factor_status
		  
		  * **-10**
                    The factorization failed; the return status from the
                    factorization package is given in the component
                    inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * **-11**
                    The solution of a set of linear equations using
                    factors from the factorization package failed; the
                    return status from the factorization package is
                    given in the component inform.factor_status.

		  * **-17**
                    The step is too small to make further impact.
		  
		  * **-18**
                    Too many iterations have been performed. This may
                    happen if control.maxit is too small, but may also
                    be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
		  
		  * **-19**
                    The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen
                    if control.cpu_time_limit is too small, but may also
                    be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
		  
		  * **-82**

		  * **2**
                    The user should compute the vector of residuals
                    $c(x)$ at the point $x$ indicated in x
                    and then re-enter the function. The required value
                    should be set in c, and eval_status should be set
                    to 0. If the user is unable to evaluate $c(x)$
                    for instance, if the function is undefined at
                    $x$ the user need not set c, but should then
                    set eval_status to a non-zero value.
		  
		  * **3**
                    The user should compute the Jacobian of the vector
                    of residual functions, $\nabla_x c(x)$, at the
                    point $x$ indicated in x and then re-enter the
                    function. The l-th component of the Jacobian stored

                    of $J$ in the earlier call to nls_import
                    should be set in J_val[l], for l = 0, ..., J_ne-1
                    and eval_status should be set to 0. If the user is
                    unable to evaluate a component of $J$ for
                    instance, if a component of the matrix is undefined
                    at $x$ the user need not set J_val, but should
                    then set eval_status to a non-zero value.

		  * **4**
                    The user should compute the matrix $H =
                    \sum_{i=1}^m v_i \nabla_{xx}c_i(x)$ of weighted
                    residual Hessian evaluated at x= $x$ and v=
                    $v$ and then re-enter the function. The l-th
                    component of the matrix stored according to the
                    scheme specified for the remainder of $H$ in
                    the earlier call to nls_import should be set in
                    H_val[l], for l = 0, ..., H_ne-1 and eval_status
                    should be set to 0. If the user is unable to
                    evaluate a component of $H$ for instance, if a
                    component of the matrix is undefined at $x$
                    the user need not set H_val, but should then set
                    eval_status to a non-zero value. **Note** that this
                    return will not happen if the Gauss-Newton model is
                    selected.
		  
		  * **7**
                    The user should compute the entries of the matrix

                    $\nabla_{xx}c_i(x) v$ between
                    $\nabla_{xx}c_i(x)$, the Hessian of the i-th
                    component of the residual $c(x)$ at x=
                    $x$, and v= $v$ and then re-enter the
                    function. The l-th component of the matrix stored
                    according to the scheme specified for the remainder
                    of $P$ in the earlier call to nls_import
                    should be set in P_val[l], for l = 0, ..., P_ne-1
                    and eval_status should be set to 0. If the user is
                    unable to evaluate a component of $P$ for
                    instance, if a component of the matrix is undefined
                    at $x$ the user need not set P_val, but should
                    then set eval_status to a non-zero value. **Note**
                    that this return will not happen if either the
                    Gauss-Newton or Newton models is selected.

                    Gauss-Newton or Newton models is selected.

	*
		- eval_status

		- is a scalar variable of type :ref:`ipc_<doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_>`, that is used to indicate if objective function/gradient/Hessian values can be provided (see above)

	*
		- n

		- is a scalar variable of type :ref:`ipc_<doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_>`, that holds the number of variables

	*
		- m

		- is a scalar variable of type :ref:`ipc_<doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_>`, that holds the number of residuals.

	*
		- x

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the values $x$ of the optimization variables. The j-th component of x, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains $x_j$.

	*
		- c

		- is a one-dimensional array of size m and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the residual $c(x)$. The i-th component of c, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains $c_j(x)$. See status = 2, above, for more details.

	*
		- g

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the gradient $g = \nabla_xf(x)$ of the objective function. The j-th component of g, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains $g_j$.

	*
		- transpose

		- is a scalar variable of type bool, that indicates whether the product with Jacobian or its transpose should be obtained when status=5.

	*
		- u

		- is a one-dimensional array of size max(n,m) and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that is used for reverse communication. See status = 5,6 above for more details.

	*
		- v

		- is a one-dimensional array of size max(n,m) and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that is used for reverse communication. See status = 5,6,7 above for more details.

	*
		- y

		- is a one-dimensional array of size m and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that is used for reverse communication. See status = 6 above for more details.

	*
		- p_ne

		- is a scalar variable of type :ref:`ipc_<doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_>`, that holds the number of entries in the residual-Hessians-vector product matrix, $P$.

	*
		- P_val

		- is a one-dimensional array of size P_ne and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the values of the entries of the residual-Hessians-vector product matrix, $P$. See status = 7, above, for more details.
