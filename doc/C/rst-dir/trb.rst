introduction to function calls
------------------------------

To solve a given problem, functions from the trb package must be 
called in the following order:

* :ref:`trb_initialize <doxid-galahad__trb_8h_1a9bffc46178a3e0b7eb2927d1c50440a1>` - provide default control parameters and set up initial data structures

* :ref:`trb_read_specfile <doxid-galahad__trb_8h_1a4eaafdaf5187c8b91c119ce9395469e9>` (optional) - override control values by reading replacement values from a file

* :ref:`trb_import <doxid-galahad__trb_8h_1a13bc38fb28201adb78af7acf910ff0d8>` - set up problem data structures and fixed values

* :ref:`trb_reset_control <doxid-galahad__trb_8h_1a550c3ca1966ea0fa9de84423b8658cd7>` (optional) - possibly change control parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved

* solve the problem by calling one of
  
  * :ref:`trb_solve_with_mat <doxid-galahad__trb_8h_1a5a58e6c0c022eb451f14c82d653967f7>` - solve using function calls to evaluate function, gradient and Hessian values
  
  * :ref:`trb_solve_without_mat <doxid-galahad__trb_8h_1a376b81748cec0bf992542d80b8d38f49>` - solve using function calls to evaluate function and gradient values and Hessian-vector products
  
  * :ref:`trb_solve_reverse_with_mat <doxid-galahad__trb_8h_1a7bb520e36666386824b216a84be08837>` - solve returning to the calling program to obtain function, gradient and Hessian values, or
  
  * :ref:`trb_solve_reverse_without_mat <doxid-galahad__trb_8h_1a95eac11acf02fe0d6eb4bc39ace5a100>` - solve returning to the calling prorgram to obtain function and gradient values and Hessian-vector products

* :ref:`trb_information <doxid-galahad__trb_8h_1a105f41a31d49c59885c3372090bec776>` (optional) - recover information about the solution and solution process

* :ref:`trb_terminate <doxid-galahad__trb_8h_1a739c7a44ddd0ce7b350cfa6da54948d0>` - deallocate data structures

See the :ref:`examples <doxid-index_trb_examples>` section for

example calls
-------------

This is an example of how to use the package to solve a bound-constrained
multi-dimensional optimization problem;
the code is available in $GALAHAD/src/trb/C/trbt.c .
A variety of supported Hessian matrix storage formats are shown.

Notice that C-style indexing is used, and that this is flagged by setting 
``control.f_indexing`` to ``false``. The floating-point type ``rpc_``
is set in ``galahad_precision.h`` to ``double`` by default, but to ``float``
if the preprocessor variable ``SINGLE`` is defined. Similarly, the integer
type ``ipc_`` from ``galahad_precision.h`` is set to ``int`` by default, 
but to ``int64_t`` if the preprocessor variable ``INTEGER_64`` is defined.

.. include :: ../../../src/trb/C/trbt.c
   :code: C

This is the same example, but now fortran-style indexing is used;
the code is available in $GALAHAD/src/trb/C/trbtf.c .

.. include :: ../../../src/trb/C/trbtf.c
   :code: C
