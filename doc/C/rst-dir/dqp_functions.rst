typedefs
--------

.. index:: pair: typedef; spc_
.. _doxid-galahad__spc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef float spc_

``spc_`` is real single precision

.. index:: pair: typedef; rpc_
.. _doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef double rpc_

``rpc_`` is the real working precision used, but may be changed to ``float`` by
defining the  preprocessor variable ``SINGLE``.

.. index:: pair: typedef; ipc_
.. _doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef int ipc_

``ipc_`` is the default integer word length used, but may be changed to 
``int64_t`` by defining the  preprocessor variable ``INTEGER_64``.

		  * **-9**
                    The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the
                    return status from the factorization package is
                    given in the component inform.factor_status
		  
		  * **-10**
                    The factorization failed; the return status from the

                    given in the component inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * **-16**

                    happen if control.maxit is too small, but may also
                    be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
		  
		  * **-19**
                    The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen
                    if control.cpu_time_limit is too small, but may also

                    respectively.
		  
		  * **-3**
                    The restrictions n > 0 and m > 0 or requirement that
                    a type contains its relevant string 'dense',

                    been violated.
		  
		  * **-5**
                    The simple-bound constraints are inconsistent.
		  
		  * **-7**
                    The constraints appear to have no feasible point.
		  
		  * **-9**
                    The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the
                    return status from the factorization package is
                    given in the component inform.factor_status
		  
		  * **-10**
                    The factorization failed; the return status from the
                    factorization package is given in the component
                    inform.factor_status.

                    The solution of a set of linear equations using
                    factors from the factorization package failed; the
                    return status from the factorization package is
                    given in the component inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * **-16**
                    The problem is so ill-conditioned that further

		  * **-18**
                    Too many iterations have been performed. This may
                    happen if control.maxit is too small, but may also
                    be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
		  
		  * **-19**
                    The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen
                    if control.cpu_time_limit is too small, but may also
