typedefs
--------

.. index:: pair: typedef; spc_
.. _doxid-galahad__spc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef float spc_

``spc_`` is real single precision

.. index:: pair: typedef; rpc_
.. _doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef double rpc_

``rpc_`` is the real working precision used, but may be changed to ``float`` by
defining the  preprocessor variable ``SINGLE``.

.. _doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef int ipc_

``ipc_`` is the default integer word length used, but may be changed to 
``int64_t`` by defining the  preprocessor variable ``INTEGER_64``.
