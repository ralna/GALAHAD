typedefs
--------

.. index:: pair: typedef; spc_
.. _doxid-galahad__spc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef float spc_

``spc_`` is real single precision

.. index:: pair: typedef; rpc_
.. _doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef double rpc_

``rpc_`` is the real working precision used, but may be changed to ``float`` by
defining the  preprocessor variable ``SINGLE``.

.. index:: pair: typedef; ipc_
.. _doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef int ipc_

``ipc_`` is the default integer word length used, but may be changed to

	:widths: 20 80

	*
		- data

		- holds private internal data

	*
		- userdata

		- is a structure that allows data to be passed into the function and derivative evaluation programs.

	*
		- status

		- 
		  is a scalar variable of type :ref:`ipc_<doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_>`, that gives the entry and exit status from the package.
		  
		  On initial entry, status must be set to 1.
		  
		  Possible exit values are:
		  
		  * **0**
                    The run was successful.
		  
		  * **-1**
                    An allocation error occurred. A message indicating
                    the offending array is written on unit
                    control.error, and the returned allocation status
                    and a string containing the name of the offending
                    array are held in inform.alloc_status and
                    inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * **-2**
                    A deallocation error occurred. A message indicating
                    the offending array is written on unit control.error
                    and the returned allocation status and a string
                    containing the name of the offending array are held
                    in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc
                    respectively.
		  
		  * **-3**
                    The restrictions n > 0, o > 0 or requirement that a
                    type contains its relevant string 'coordinate',
                    'sparse_by_rows', 'sparse_by_columns',
                    'dense_by_rows' or 'dense_by_columns' has been

		  * **-4**
                    The simple-bound constraints are inconsistent.
		  
		  * **-9**
                    The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the
                    return status from the factorization package is
                    given in the component inform.factor_status

                    inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * **-18**
                    Too many iterations have been performed. This may
                    happen if control.maxit is too small, but may also
                    be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.

                    should be ignored. If the product cannot be formed,

                    preconditioner $P$ with a given output vector
                    $v$ is required from the user. The vector
