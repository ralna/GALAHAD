introduction to function calls
------------------------------

To solve a given problem, functions from the xxx package must be 
called in the following order:


See the :ref:`examples <doxid-index_xxx_examples>` section for 
illustrations of use.

example calls
-------------

This is an example of how to use the package to ... ;
the code is available in $GALAHAD/src/xxx/C/xxxt.c .
A variety of supported Hessian and constraint matrix storage formats are shown.

Notice that C-style indexing is used, and that this is flaggeed by setting 
``control.f_indexing`` to ``false``. The floating-point type ``real_wp_``
is set in ``galahad_precision.h`` to ``double`` by default, but to ``float``
if the preproccesor variable ``GALAHAD_SINGLE`` is defined.

.. include :: ../../../src/xxx/C/xxxt.c
   :code: C

This is the same example, but now fortran-style indexing is used;
the code is available in $GALAHAD/src/xxx/C/xxxtf.c .

.. include :: ../../../src/xxx/C/xxxtf.c
   :code: C
