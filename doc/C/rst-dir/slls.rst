introduction to function calls
------------------------------

To solve a given problem, functions from the slls package must be 
called in the following order:

* :ref:`slls_initialize <doxid-galahad__slls_8h_1a12708c98f2473e03cd46f4dcfdb03409>` - provide default control parameters and set up initial data structures

* :ref:`slls_read_specfile <doxid-galahad__slls_8h_1aa24c9c2fdaaaac84df5b98abbf84c859>` (optional) - override control values by reading replacement values from a file

* set up problem data structures and fixed values by caling one of
  
  * :ref:`slls_import <doxid-galahad__slls_8h_1afacd84f0b7592f4532cf7b77d278282f>` - in the case that A$_o$ is explicitly available
  
  * :ref:`slls_import_without_a <doxid-galahad__slls_8h_1a419f9b0769b4389beffbbc5f7d0fd58c>` - in the case that only the effect of applying A$_o$ and its transpose to a vector is possible

* :ref:`slls_reset_control <doxid-galahad__slls_8h_1a96981ac9a0e3f44b2b38362fc3ab9991>` (optional) - possibly change control parameters if a sequence of problems are being solved

* solve the problem by calling one of
  
  * :ref:`slls_solve_given_a <doxid-galahad__slls_8h_1acf6d292989a5ac09f7f3e507283fb5bf>` - solve the problem using values of $A_o$
  
  * :ref:`slls_solve_reverse_a_prod <doxid-galahad__slls_8h_1ac139bc1c65cf12cb532c4ab09f3af9d0>` - solve the problem by returning to the caller for products of A$_o$ and its transpose with specified vectors

* :ref:`slls_information <doxid-galahad__slls_8h_1a457b8ee7c630715bcb43427f254b555f>` (optional) - recover information about the solution and solution process

* :ref:`slls_terminate <doxid-galahad__slls_8h_1ade863ffb6b142bfce669729f56911ac1>` - deallocate data structures

See the :ref:`examples <doxid-index_slls_examples>` section for 
illustrations of use.

example calls
-------------

This is an example of how to use the package to solve a bound-constrained 
linear least-squares problem; the code is available in 
$GALAHAD/src/slls/C/sllst.c .
A variety of supported Hessian and constraint matrix storage formats are shown.

Notice that C-style indexing is used, and that this is flagged by setting 
``control.f_indexing`` to ``false``. The floating-point type ``rpc_``
is set in ``galahad_precision.h`` to ``double`` by default, but to ``float``
if the preprocessor variable ``SINGLE`` is defined. Similarly, the integer
type ``ipc_`` from ``galahad_precision.h`` is set to ``int`` by default, 
but to ``int64_t`` if the preprocessor variable ``INTEGER_64`` is defined.

.. include :: ../../../src/slls/C/sllst.c
   :code: C

This is the same example, but now fortran-style indexing is used;
the code is available in $GALAHAD/src/slls/C/sllstf.c .

.. include :: ../../../src/slls/C/sllstf.c
   :code: C
