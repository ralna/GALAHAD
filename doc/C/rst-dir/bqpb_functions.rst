                    given in the component inform.factor_status
		  
		  * **-10**
                    The factorization failed; the return status from the

		  * **-19**
                    The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen
                    if control.cpu_time_limit is too small, but may also

                    and the returned allocation status and a string
                    containing the name of the offending array are held
                    in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc
                    respectively.
		  
		  * **-3**
                    The restriction n > 0 or requirement that h_type
                    contains its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate',
                    'sparse_by_rows', 'diagonal', 'scaled_identity',
                    'identity', 'zero' or 'none' has been violated.
		  
		  * **-5**
                    The simple-bound constraints are inconsistent.
		  
		  * **-9**
                    The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the
                    return status from the factorization package is
                    given in the component inform.factor_status
		  
		  * **-10**
                    The factorization failed; the return status from the
                    factorization package is given in the component
                    inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * **-11**
                    The solution of a set of linear equations using
                    factors from the factorization package failed; the
                    return status from the factorization package is
                    given in the component inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * **-16**
                    The problem is so ill-conditioned that further
                    progress is impossible.
		  
		  * **-17**
                    The step is too small to make further impact.
		  
		  * **-18**
                    Too many iterations have been performed. This may
                    happen if control.maxit is too small, but may also
                    be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
		  
		  * **-19**
                    The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen
                    if control.cpu_time_limit is too small, but may also
                    be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
		  
		  * **-23**
                    An entry from the strict upper triangle of $H$
                    has been specified.

	*
		- n

		- is a scalar variable of type :ref:`ipc_<doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_>`, that holds the number of variables

	*
		- w

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the values of the weights $w$.

		- g

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the linear term $g$ of the objective function. The j-th component of g, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains $g_j$.

	*
		- f

		- is a scalar of type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the constant term $f$ of the objective function.

	*
		- x_l

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the lower bounds $x^l$ on the variables $x$. The j-th component of x_l, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains $x^l_j$.

	*
		- x_u

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the upper bounds $x^l$ on the variables $x$. The j-th component of x_u, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains $x^l_j$.

		- x

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the values $x$ of the optimization variables. The j-th component of x, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains $x_j$.

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the values $z$ of the dual variables. The j-th component of z, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains $z_j$.

	*
		- x_stat

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type :ref:`ipc_<doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_>`, that gives the optimal status of the problem variables. If x_stat(j) is negative, the variable $x_j$ most likely lies on its lower bound, if it is positive, it lies on its upper bound, and if it is zero, it lies between its bounds.
