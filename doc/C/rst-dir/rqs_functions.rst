typedefs
--------

.. index:: pair: typedef; spc_
.. _doxid-galahad__spc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef float spc_

``spc_`` is real single precision

.. index:: pair: typedef; rpc_
.. _doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef double rpc_

``rpc_`` is the real working precision used, but may be changed to ``float`` by
defining the  preprocessor variable ``SINGLE``.

.. index:: pair: typedef; ipc_
.. _doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef int ipc_

``ipc_`` is the default integer word length used, but may be changed to 
``int64_t`` by defining the  preprocessor variable ``INTEGER_64``.

		- data

		- holds private internal data

	*
		- status

		- 
		  is a scalar variable of type :ref:`ipc_<doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_>`, that gives the entry and exit status from the package.
		  
		  On initial entry, status must be set to 1.
		  
		  Possible exit values are:
		  
		  * **0**
                    The run was successful.
		  
		  * **-1**
                    An allocation error occurred. A message indicating
                    the offending array is written on unit
                    control.error, and the returned allocation status
                    and a string containing the name of the offending
                    array are held in inform.alloc_status and
                    inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * **-2**
                    A deallocation error occurred. A message indicating
                    the offending array is written on unit control.error
                    and the returned allocation status and a string
                    containing the name of the offending array are held
                    in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc
                    respectively.
		  
		  * **-3**
                    The restrictions n > 0, power > 2, weight > 0 and m
                    > 0 or requirement that a type contains its relevant
                    string 'dense', 'coordinate', 'sparse_by_rows',
                    'diagonal' or 'identity' has been violated.
		  
		  * **-9**
                    The analysis phase of the factorization of the
                    matrix (1) failed.
		  
		  * **-10**
                    The factorization of the matrix (1) failed.
		  
		  * **-15**
                    The matrix M appears not to be diagonally dominant.
		  
		  * **-16**
                    The problem is so ill-conditioned that further
                    progress is impossible.
		  
		  * **-18**
                    Too many factorizations have been required. This may
                    happen if control.max factorizations is too small,
                    but may also be symptomatic of a badly scaled
                    problem.

	*
		- n

	*
		- power

		- is a scalar of type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the order of regularisation, $p$, used. power must be no smaller than 2.

	*
		- weight

	*
		- c

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the linear term $c$ of the objective function. The j-th component of c, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains $c_j$.

	*
		- f

		- is a scalar of type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the constant term $f$ of the objective function.

	*
		- H_ne

		- is a scalar variable of type :ref:`ipc_<doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_>`, that holds the number of entries in the lower triangular part of the Hessian matrix $H$.

	*
		- H_val

		- is a one-dimensional array of size h_ne and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the values of the entries of the lower triangular part of the Hessian matrix $H$ in any of the available storage schemes.

	*
		- x
