typedefs
--------

.. index:: pair: typedef; spc_
.. _doxid-galahad__spc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef float spc_

``spc_`` is real single precision

.. index:: pair: typedef; rpc_
.. _doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef double rpc_

``rpc_`` is the real working precision used, but may be changed to ``float`` by
defining the  preprocessor variable ``SINGLE``.

.. _doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef int ipc_

``ipc_`` is the default integer word length used, but may be changed to 
``int64_t`` by defining the  preprocessor variable ``INTEGER_64``.

	*
		- data

		- holds private internal data

	*
		- status

		- 
		  is a scalar variable of type :ref:`ipc_<doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_>`, that gives the exit status from the package.
		  
		  Possible values are:
		  
		  * **0**
                    The required solution was obtained.
		  
		  * **-1**
                    An allocation error occurred. A message indicating
                    the offending array is written on unit
                    control.error, and the returned allocation status
                    and a string containing the name of the offending
                    array are held in inform.alloc_status and
                    inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * **-2**
                    A deallocation error occurred. A message indicating
                    the offending array is written on unit control.error
                    and the returned allocation status and a string
                    containing the name of the offending array are held
                    in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc
                    respectively.
		  
		  * **-11**
                    An error was reported by SLS_solve. The return
                    status from SLS solve is given in
                    inform.sls_inform.status. See the documentation for
                    the GALAHAD package SLS for further details.
		  
		  * **-14**
                    An error was reported by ULS_solve. The return
                    status from ULS_solve is given in
                    inform.uls_solve_status. See the documentation for
