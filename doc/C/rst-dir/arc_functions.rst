typedefs
--------

.. index:: pair: typedef; spc_
.. _doxid-galahad__spc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef float spc_

``spc_`` is real single precision

.. index:: pair: typedef; rpc_
.. _doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef double rpc_

``rpc_`` is the real working precision used, but may be changed to ``float`` by
defining the  preprocessor variable ``SINGLE``.

.. _doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef int ipc_

``ipc_`` is the default integer word length used, but may be changed to 
``int64_t`` by defining the  preprocessor variable ``INTEGER_64``.

                    The restriction n > 0 or requirement that type
                    contains its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate',
                    'sparse_by_rows', 'diagonal' or 'absent' has been
                    violated.
		  
		  * **-7**
                    The objective function appears to be unbounded from
                    below
		  
		  * **-9**
                    The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the
                    return status from the factorization package is
                    given in the component inform.factor_status
		  
		  * **-10**
                    The factorization failed; the return status from the

                    inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * **-11**
                    The solution of a set of linear equations using

                    return status from the factorization package is
                    given in the component inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * **-16**
                    The problem is so ill-conditioned that further
                    progress is impossible.
		  
		  * **-18**
                    Too many iterations have been performed. This may
                    happen if control.maxit is too small, but may also
                    be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
		  
		  * **-19**
                    The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen
                    if control.cpu_time_limit is too small, but may also
                    be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
		  
		  * **-82**

	)

Find a local minimizer of a given function using a regularization method.

This call is for the case where access to $H = \nabla_{xx}f(x)$ is provided by Hessian-vector products, but function/derivative information is only available by returning to the calling procedure.

		- data

		- holds private internal data

	*
		- status

		- 
		  is a scalar variable of type :ref:`ipc_<doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_>`, that gives the entry and exit status from the package.
		  
		  On initial entry, status must be set to 1.
		  
		  Possible exit values are:
		  
		  * **0**
                     The run was successful
		  
		  * **-1**
                    An allocation error occurred. A message indicating
                    the offending array is written on unit
                    control.error, and the returned allocation status
                    and a string containing the name of the offending
                    array are held in inform.alloc_status and
                    inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * **-2**
                    A deallocation error occurred. A message indicating
                    the offending array is written on unit control.error
                    and the returned allocation status and a string
                    containing the name of the offending array are held
                    in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc
                    respectively.
		  
		  * **-3**
                    The restriction n > 0 or requirement that type
                    contains its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate',
                    'sparse_by_rows', 'diagonal' or 'absent' has been
                    violated.
		  
		  * **-7**
                    The objective function appears to be unbounded from
                    below
		  
		  * **-9**
                    The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the
                    return status from the factorization package is
                    given in the component inform.factor_status
		  
		  * **-10**
                    The factorization failed; the return status from the
                    factorization package is given in the component
                    inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * **-11**
                    The solution of a set of linear equations using
                    factors from the factorization package failed; the
                    return status from the factorization package is
                    given in the component inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * **-16**
                    The problem is so ill-conditioned that further
                    progress is impossible.
		  
		  * **-18**
                    Too many iterations have been performed. This may
                    happen if control.maxit is too small, but may also
                    be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
		  
		  * **-19**
                    The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen
                    if control.cpu_time_limit is too small, but may also
                    be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
		  
		  * **-82**
                    The user has forced termination of solver by
                    removing the file named control.alive_file from unit
                    unit control.alive_unit.

		  * **2**
                    The user should compute the objective function value
                    $f(x)$ at the point $x$ indicated in x
                    and then re-enter the function. The required value
                    should be set in f, and eval_status should be set
                    to 0. If the user is unable to evaluate $f(x)$
                    for instance, if the function is undefined at
                    $x$ the user need not set f, but should then
                    set eval_status to a non-zero value.
		  
		  * **3**
                    The user should compute the gradient of the
                    objective function $\nabla_x f(x)$ at the
                    point $x$ indicated in x and then re-enter the
                    function. The value of the i-th component of the g
                    radient should be set in g[i], for i = 0, ..., n-1
                    and eval_status should be set to 0. If the user is
                    unable to evaluate a component of $\nabla_x
                    f(x)$ for instance if a component of the gradient is
                    undefined at $x$ -the user need not set g, but
                    should then set eval_status to a non-zero value.
		  
		  * **5**
                    The user should compute the product
                    $\nabla_{xx} f(x)v$ of the Hessian of the
                    objective function $\nabla_{xx} f(x)$ at the
                    point $x$ indicated in x with the vector
                    $v$, add the result to the vector $u$
                    and then re-enter the function. The vectors
                    $u$ and $v$ are given in u and v
                    respectively, the resulting vector $u +
                    \nabla_{xx} f(x)v$ should be set in u and
                    eval_status should be set to 0. If the user is
                    unable to evaluate the product for instance, if a
                    component of the Hessian is undefined at $x$
                    the user need not alter u, but should then set
                    eval_status to a non-zero value.
		  
		  * **6**
                    The user should compute the product $u =
                    P(x)v$ of their preconditioner $P(x)$ at the
                    point x indicated in $x$ with the vector
                    $v$ and then re-enter the function. The vector
                    $v$ is given in v, the resulting vector
                    $u = P(x)v$ should be set in u and eval_status
                    should be set to 0. If the user is unable to
                    evaluate the product for instance, if a component of
                    the preconditioner is undefined at $x$ the
                    user need not set u, but should then set eval_status
                    to a non-zero value.
