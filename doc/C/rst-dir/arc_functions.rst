		)

Find a local minimizer of a given function using a regularization method.

This call is for the case where access to :math:`H = \nabla_{xx}f(x)` is provided by Hessian-vector products, but function/derivative information is only available by returning to the calling procedure.



.. rubric:: Parameters:

	*
		- data

		- holds private internal data

	*
		- status

		- 
		  is a scalar variable of type int, that gives the entry and exit status from the package.
		  
		  On initial entry, status must be set to 1.
		  
		  Possible exit are:
		  
		  * 0. The run was succesful
		  
		  
		  
		  * -1. An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending array is written on unit control.error, and the returned allocation status and a string containing the name of the offending array are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * -2. A deallocation error occurred. A message indicating the offending array is written on unit control.error and the returned allocation status and a string containing the name of the offending array are held in inform.alloc_status and inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * -3. The restriction n > 0 or requirement that type contains its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate', 'sparse_by_rows', 'diagonal' or 'absent' has been violated.
		  
		  * -7. The objective function appears to be unbounded from below
		  
		  * -9. The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the return status from the factorization package is given in the component inform.factor_status
		  
		  * -10. The factorization failed; the return status from the factorization package is given in the component inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * -11. The solution of a set of linear equations using factors from the factorization package failed; the return status from the factorization package is given in the component inform.factor_status.
		  
		  * -16. The problem is so ill-conditioned that further progress is impossible.
		  
		  * -18. Too many iterations have been performed. This may happen if control.maxit is too small, but may also be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
		  
		  * -19. The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen if control.cpu_time_limit is too small, but may also be symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.
		  
		  * -82. The user has forced termination of solver by removing the file named control.alive_file from unit unit control.alive_unit.

	*
		- status

		- 
		  (continued)
		  
		  * 2. The user should compute the objective function value :math:`f(x)` at the point :math:`x` indicated in x and then re-enter the function. The required value should be set in f, and eval_status should be set to 0. If the user is unable to evaluate :math:`f(x)` for instance, if the function is undefined at :math:`x` the user need not set f, but should then set eval_status to a non-zero value.
		  
		  * 3. The user should compute the gradient of the objective function :math:`\nabla_x f(x)` at the point :math:`x` indicated in x and then re-enter the function. The value of the i-th component of the g radient should be set in g[i], for i = 0, ..., n-1 and eval_status should be set to 0. If the user is unable to evaluate a component of :math:`\nabla_x f(x)` for instance if a component of the gradient is undefined at :math:`x` -the user need not set g, but should then set eval_status to a non-zero value.
		  
		  * 5. The user should compute the product :math:`\nabla_{xx} f(x)v` of the Hessian of the objective function :math:`\nabla_{xx} f(x)` at the point :math:`x` indicated in x with the vector :math:`v`, add the result to the vector :math:`u` and then re-enter the function. The vectors :math:`u` and :math:`v` are given in u and v respectively, the resulting vector :math:`u + \nabla_{xx} f(x)v` should be set in u and eval_status should be set to 0. If the user is unable to evaluate the product for instance, if a component of the Hessian is undefined at :math:`x` the user need not alter u, but should then set eval_status to a non-zero value.
		  
		  * 6. The user should compute the product :math:`u = P(x)v` of their preconditioner :math:`P(x)` at the point x indicated in :math:`x` with the vector :math:`v` and then re-enter the function. The vector :math:`v` is given in v, the resulting vector :math:`u = P(x)v` should be set in u and eval_status should be set to 0. If the user is unable to evaluate the product for instance, if a component of the preconditioner is undefined at :math:`x` the user need not set u, but should then set eval_status to a non-zero value.
