typedefs
--------

.. index:: pair: typedef; spc_
.. _doxid-galahad__spc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef float spc_

.. _doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef double rpc_

``rpc_`` is the real working precision used, but may be changed to ``float`` by
defining the  preprocessor variable ``SINGLE``.

.. _doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef int ipc_

``ipc_`` is the default integer word length used, but may be changed to 
``int64_t`` by defining the  preprocessor variable ``INTEGER_64``.

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the upper bounds $x^l$ on the variables $x$. The j-th component of x_u, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains $x^l_j$.

	*
		- x

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the values $x$ of the optimization variables. The j-th component of x, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains $x_j$.

	*
		- c

		- is a one-dimensional array of size m and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the residual $c(x)$. The i-th component of c, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains $c_j(x)$.

	*
		- y

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the values $y$ of the Lagrange multipliers for the general linear constraints. The j-th component of y, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains $y_j$.

	*
		- z

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type :ref:`rpc_<doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_>`, that holds the values $z$ of the dual variables. The j-th component of z, j = 0, ... , n-1, contains $z_j$.

	*
		- x_stat

		- is a one-dimensional array of size n and type :ref:`ipc_<doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_>`, that gives the optimal status of the problem variables. If x_stat(j) is negative, the variable $x_j$ most likely lies on its lower bound, if it is positive, it lies on its upper bound, and if it is zero, it lies between its bounds.

	*
		- c_stat

		- is a one-dimensional array of size m and type :ref:`ipc_<doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_>`, that gives the optimal status of the general linear constraints. If c_stat(i) is negative, the constraint value $a_i^Tx$ most likely lies on its lower bound, if it is positive, it lies on its upper bound, and if it is zero, it lies between its bounds.
