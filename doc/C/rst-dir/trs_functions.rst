typedefs
--------

.. index:: pair: typedef; spc_
.. _doxid-galahad__spc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef float spc_

``spc_`` is real single precision

.. index:: pair: typedef; rpc_
.. _doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef double rpc_

``rpc_`` is the real working precision used, but may be changed to ``float`` by
defining the  preprocessor variable ``SINGLE``.

.. index:: pair: typedef; ipc_
.. _doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	typedef int ipc_

``ipc_`` is the default integer word length used, but may be changed to 
``int64_t`` by defining the  preprocessor variable ``INTEGER_64``.

                    An allocation error occurred. A message indicating
                    the offending array is written on unit
                    control.error, and the returned allocation status
                    and a string containing the name of the offending
                    array are held in inform.alloc_status and
                    inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * **-2**
                    A deallocation error occurred. A message indicating
                    the offending array is written on unit control.error
                    and the returned allocation status and a string

		  * **-3**
                    The restrictions n > 0, radius > 0 and m > 0 or
                    requirement that a type contains its relevant string
                    'dense', 'coordinate', 'sparse_by_rows', 'diagonal'
                    or 'identity' has been violated.
		  
		  * **-9**
                    The analysis phase of the factorization of the
                    matrix (1) failed.
		  
		  * **-10**
                    The factorization of the matrix (1) failed.
		  
		  * **-15**
                    The matrix M appears not to be diagonally dominant.
		  
		  * **-16**
                    The problem is so ill-conditioned that further
                    progress is impossible.
		  
		  * **-18**
                    Too many factorizations have been required. This may
                    happen if control.max factorizations is too small,
                    but may also be symptomatic of a badly scaled
                    problem.
