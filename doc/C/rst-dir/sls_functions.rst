.. _doxid-galahad__rpc_8h_:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

parameters. An in-depth discussion of specification files is 
:ref:`available<details-spec_file>`, and a detailed list 
of keywords with associated default values is provided in 
\$GALAHAD/src/sls/SLS.template. 
See also Table 2.1 in the Fortran documentation provided in 
\$GALAHAD/doc/sls.pdf for a list of how these keywords 
relate to the components of the control structure.

.. list-table::
	:widths: 20 80

	*
		- part

		- is a one-dimensional array of type char that specifies the component $M$ of the factorization that is to be used. It should be one of "L", "D", "U" or "S", and these correspond to the parts $L$, $D$, $U$ and $S$; lower or upper case variants are allowed.

	*
		- data

		- holds private internal data

	*
		- status

		- 
		  is a scalar variable of type :ref:`ipc_<doxid-galahad__ipc_8h_>`, that gives the entry and exit status from the package.
		  
		  On initial entry, status must be set to 1.
		  
		  Possible exit values are:
		  
		  * **0**
                    The required solution was obtained.
		  
		  * **-1**
                    An allocation error occurred. A message indicating
                    the offending array is written on unit
                    control.error, and the returned allocation status
                    and a string containing the name of the offending
                    array are held in inform.alloc_status and
                    inform.bad_alloc respectively.
		  
		  * **-2**
                    A deallocation error occurred. A message indicating
