      **Parameters:**

      n : int
          holds the number of variables.
      H_type : string
          specifies the symmetric storage scheme used for the Hessian $H$.
          It should be one of 'coordinate', 'sparse_by_rows', 'dense',
          'diagonal', 'scaled_identity', 'identity', 'zero'  or 'none'; 
          lower or upper case variants are allowed.
      H_ne : int
          holds the number of entries in the  lower triangular part of
          $H$ in the sparse co-ordinate storage scheme. It need
          not be set for any of the other schemes.
      H_row : ndarray(H_ne)
          holds the row indices of the lower triangular part of $H$
          in the sparse co-ordinate storage scheme. It need not be set for
          any of the other schemes, and in this case can be None.
      H_col : ndarray(H_ne)
          holds the column indices of the  lower triangular part of
          $H$ in either the sparse co-ordinate, or the sparse row-wise
          storage scheme. It need not be set when the other storage schemes
          are used, and in this case can be None.
      H_ptr : ndarray(n+1)
          holds the starting position of each row of the lower triangular
          part of $H$, as well as the total number of entries,
          in the sparse row-wise storage scheme. It need not be set when the
          other schemes are used, and in this case can be None.
      options : dict, optional
          dictionary of control options (see ``bqp.initialize``).

   .. function:: bqp.solve_qp(n, f, g, h_ne, H_val, x_l, x_u, x, z)

      Find a solution to the bound-constrained convex quadratic program 
      involving the quadratic objective function $q(x)$.

      **Parameters:**

      n : int
          holds the number of variables.
      f : float
          holds the constant term $f$ in the objective function.
      g : ndarray(n)
          holds the values of the linear term $g$ in the objective function.
      h_ne : int
          holds the number of entries in the lower triangular part of 
          the Hessian $H$.
      H_val : ndarray(h_ne)
          holds the values of the nonzeros in the lower triangle of the Hessian
          $H$ in the same order as specified in the sparsity pattern in 
          ``bqp.load``.
      x_l : ndarray(n)
          holds the values of the lower bounds $x_l$ on the variables.
          The lower bound on any component of $x$ that is unbounded from 
          below should be set no larger than minus ``options.infinity``.
      x_u : ndarray(n)
          holds the values of the upper bounds $x_l$ on the variables.
          The upper bound on any component of $x$ that is unbounded from 
          above should be set no smaller than ``options.infinity``.
      x : ndarray(n)
          holds the initial estimate of the minimizer $x$, if known.
          This is not crucial, and if no suitable value is known, then any
          value, such as $x=0$, suffices and will be adjusted accordingly.
      z : ndarray(n)
          holds the initial estimate of the dual variables $z$
          associated with the simple bound constraints, if known.
          This is not crucial, and if no suitable value is known, then any
          value, such as $z=0$, suffices and will be adjusted accordingly.

      **Returns:**

      x : ndarray(n)
          holds the values of the approximate minimizer $x$ after
          a successful call.

          simple bound constraints.
      x_stat : ndarray(n)
          holds the return status for each variable. The i-th component will be
          negative if the $i$-th variable lies on its lower bound, 
          positive if it lies on its upper bound, and zero if it lies
          between bounds.

            * **0**

              The run was succesful.

            * **-1**

              An allocation error occurred. A message indicating the

              the returned allocation status and a string containing
              the name of the offending array are held in
              inform['alloc_status'] and inform['bad_alloc'] respectively.

            * **-2**

              A deallocation error occurred.  A message indicating the
              offending array is written on unit options['error'] and
              the returned allocation status and a string containing
              the name of the offending array are held in
              inform['alloc_status'] and inform['bad_alloc'] respectively.

            * **-3**

              The restriction n > 0 or m > 0 or requirement that type contains
              its relevant string 'dense', 'coordinate', 'sparse_by_rows',
              'diagonal', 'scaled_identity',  'identity', 'zero' or 'none' 
              has been violated.

            * **-4**

              The bound constraints are inconsistent.

            * **-7**

              The objective function appears to be unbounded from below
              on the feasible set.

            * **-9**

              The analysis phase of the factorization failed; the return
              status from the factorization package is given by
              inform['factor_status'].

            * **-10**

              The factorization failed; the return status from the
              factorization package is given by inform['factor_status'].

            * **-11**

              The solution of a set of linear equations using factors
              from the factorization package failed; the return status
              from the factorization package is given by
              inform['factor_status'].

            * **-16**

              The problem is so ill-conditioned that further progress
              is impossible.

            * **-18**

              Too many iterations have been performed. This may happen if
              options['maxit'] is too small, but may also be symptomatic
              of a badly scaled problem.

            * **-19**

              The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen if
              options['cpu_time_limit'] is too small, but may also be
              symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.

            * **-20**

              The Hessian $H$ appears to be indefinite.

            * **-23** 

              An entry from the strict upper triangle of $H$ has been 
              specified.
