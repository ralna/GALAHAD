.. module:: galahad.glrt

The ``glrt`` package uses a **Krylov-subspace iteration** to find an 
approximation of the global minimizer of 
**regularized quadratic objective function**. 
The aim is to minimize the regularized quadratic objective function
$$r(x) = f + g^T x + \frac{1}{2} x^T H x + \frac{\sigma}{p} \|x\|_{M}^p,$$ 
where the **weight** $\sigma \geq 0$, the **power** $p \geq 2$, 
and where the $M$-norm of $x$ is defined to be $\|x\|_{M} = \sqrt{x^T M x}$.
The method may be suitable for large problems as no factorization of $H$ is
required. Reverse communication is used to obtain
matrix-vector products of the form $H z$ and $M^{-1} z.$

See Section 4 of $GALAHAD/doc/glrt.pdf for a brief description of the
method employed and other details.
