   .. function:: nodend.initialize()

      Set default option values and initialize private data.

      **Returns:**

      options : dict
        dictionary containing default control options:
          version : str
            specify the version of METIS to be used. Possible values
            are 4.0, 5.1 and 5.2.
          error : int
             error and warning diagnostics occur on stream error.
          out : int
             general output occurs on stream out.
          print_level : int
             the level of output required is specified by print_level.
          no_metis_4_use_5_instead : bool
             if `` no_metis_4_use_5_instead`` is True, and METIS 4.0 is 
             not availble, use Metis 5.2 instead.
          prefix : str
            all output lines will be prefixed by the string contained
            in quotes within ``prefix``, e.g. 'word' (note the qutoes)
            will result in the prefix word.
          metis4_ptype : int
            the partitioning method employed. 0 = multilevel recursive 
             bisectioning: 1 = multilevel k-way partitioning
          metis4_ctype : int
            the matching scheme to be used during coarsening: 
            1 = random matching, 
            2 = heavy-edge matching, 3 = sorted heavy-edge matching, and
            4 = k-way sorted heavy-edge matching.
          metis4_itype : int
            the algorithm used during initial partitioning: 
            1 = edge-based region growing and 2 = node-based region growing.
          metis4_rtype : int
            the algorithm used for refinement: 
            1 = two-sided node Fiduccia-Mattheyses (FM) refinement, and
            2 = one-sided node FM refinement.
          metis4_dbglvl : int
            the amount of progress/debugging information printed: 
            0 = nothing, 1 = timings, and $>$ 1 increasingly more.
          metis4_oflags : int
            select whether or not to compress the graph, and to order 
            connected components separately: 0 = do neither, 
            1 = try to compress the graph, 
            2 = order each connected component separately, and 3 = do both.
          metis4_pfactor : int
            the minimum degree of the vertices that will be ordered last. 
            More specifically, any vertices with a degree greater than 
            0.1 metis4_pfactor times the average degree are removed from
            the graph, an ordering of the rest of the vertices is computed, 
            and an overall ordering is computed by ordering the removed 
            vertices at the end of the overall ordering. Any value
            smaller than 1 means that no vertices will be ordered last.

            partitioning.
          metis5_objtype : int

            metis5_objtype = 2, specifies node-based nested dissection, 
            and any invalid value will be replaced by this default.
          metis5_ctype : int
            the matching scheme to be used during coarsening:

          metis5_iptype : int
            the algorithm used during initial partitioning:

            the algorithm used for refinement: 2 = Two-sided node FM refinement,
             and 3 = One-sided node FM refinement.

          metis5_minconn : int
            specify that the partitioning routines should try to minimize 
            the maximum degree of the subdomain graph: 0 = no, 1 = yes, and

            identified and ordered separately: 0 = no, and 1 = yes.

            the graph, an ordering of the rest of the vertices is computed,

   .. function:: nodend.order(n, A_type, A_ne, A_row, A_col, A_ptr, options=None)

      A_type : string
          specifies the symmetric storage scheme used for $A$.
          It should be one of 'coordinate' or 'sparse_by_rows';
          lower or upper case variants are allowed. If A_type is not one

          holds the row indices of the lower triangular part of $A$
          in the sparse co-ordinate storage scheme. It need not be set for
          the sparse-by-row scheme, and in this case can be None.
      A_col : ndarray(A_ne)
          holds the column indices of the  lower triangular part of
          $A$ in either of the supported storage schemes.
      A_ptr : ndarray(n+1)

          part of $A$, as well as the total number of entries,
          in the sparse row-wise storage scheme. It need not be set when the
          coordinate scheme is used, and in this case can be None.
