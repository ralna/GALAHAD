              A deallocation error occurred.  A message indicating the
              offending array is written on unit options['error'] and
              the returned allocation status and a string containing

              factorization package is given by inform['factor_status'].

            * **-11**

              The solution of a set of linear equations using factors
              from the factorization package failed; the return status
              from the factorization package is given by
              inform['factor_status'].

            * **-16**

              The problem is so ill-conditioned that further progress
              is impossible.

            * **-18**

              Too many iterations have been performed. This may happen if
              options['maxit'] is too small, but may also be symptomatic
              of a badly scaled problem.

            * **-19**

              The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen if
              options['cpu_time_limit'] is too small, but may also be
              symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.

            * **-82**

              The user has forced termination of the solver by removing
              the file named options['alive_file'] from unit
