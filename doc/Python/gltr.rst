GLTR

.. module:: galahad.gltr

The gltr package uses a **Krylov-subspace iteration** to find an
approximation of the global minimizer of **quadratic objective function** 
within an **ellipsoidal region**; this is commonly known as the
**trust-region subproblem**.
The aim is to minimize the quadratic objective function
$$q(x) = f + g^T x + \frac{1}{2} x^T H x,$$ 
where the vector $x$ is required to satisfy 
the ellipsoidal  **trust-region constraint** $\|x\|_{M} \leq  \Delta$, 
where the $M$-norm of $x$ is defined to be $\|x\|_{M} = \sqrt{x^T M x}$,
and where the **radius** $\Delta > 0$.
The method may be suitable for large problems as no factorization of $H$ is
required. Reverse communication is used to obtain
matrix-vector products of the form $H z$ and $M^{-1} z.$

See Section 4 of $GALAHAD/doc/gltr.pdf for a brief description of the
method employed and other details.
