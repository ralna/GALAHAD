matrix storage
--------------

The **unsymmetric** $m$ by $n$ matrix $A$ may be presented
and stored in a variety of convenient input formats. 

*Dense* storage format:
The matrix $A$ is stored as a compact dense matrix by rows, that is,
the values of the entries of each row in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
In this case, component $n \ast i + j$  of the storage array A_val
will hold the value $A_{ij}$ for $0 \leq i \leq m-1$, $0 \leq j \leq n-1$.
The string A_type = 'dense' should be specified.

*Dense by columns* storage format:
The matrix $A$ is stored as a compact dense matrix by columns, that is,
the values of the entries of each column in turn are
stored in order within an appropriate real one-dimensional array.
In this case, component $m \ast j + i$  of the storage array A_val
will hold the value $A_{ij}$ for $0 \leq i \leq m-1$, $0 \leq j \leq n-1
The string A_type = 'dense_by_columns' should be specified.

*Sparse co-ordinate* storage format:
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
For the $l$-th entry, $0 \leq l \leq ne-1$, of $A$,
its row index i, column index j and value $A_{ij}$,
$0 \leq i \leq m-1$,  $0 \leq j \leq n-1$,  are stored as the $l$-th 
components of the integer arrays A_row and A_col and real array A_val, 
respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as A_ne = $ne$.
The string A_type = 'coordinate'should be specified.

*Sparse row-wise storage* format:
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
in row i+1. For the i-th row of $A$ the i-th component of the
integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while A_ptr(m) holds the total number of entries.
The column indices j, $0 \leq j \leq n-1$, and values
$A_{ij}$ of the  nonzero entries in the i-th row are stored in components
l = A_ptr(i), $\ldots$, A_ptr(i+1)-1,  $0 \leq i \leq m-1$,
of the integer array A_col, and real array A_val, respectively.
For sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
its predecessor.
The string A_type = 'sparse_by_rows' should be specified.

*Sparse column-wise* storage format:
Once again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in column j appear directly before those
in column j+1. For the j-th column of $A$ the j-th component of the
integer array A_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this column,
while A_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries.
The row indices i, $0 \leq i \leq m-1$, and values $A_{ij}$
of the  nonzero entries in the j-th columnsare stored in components
l = A_ptr(j), $\ldots$, A_ptr(j+1)-1, $0 \leq j \leq n-1$,
of the integer array A_row, and real array A_val, respectively.
As before, for sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less
storage than the co-ordinate format.
The string A_type = 'sparse_by_columns' should be specified.
