The ``sha`` package **finds an approximation to a sparse Hessian**
using componentwise secant approximation.

**Currently only the options and inform dictionaries are exposed**; these are 
provided and used by other GALAHAD packages with Python interfaces.
Please contact us if you would like full functionality!

See Section 4 of $GALAHAD/doc/sha.pdf for a brief description of the
method employed and other details.
