PRESOLVE
========

.. module:: galahad.presolve

The ``presolve`` package **transforms** linear and quadratic programming data 
so that the resulting problem is easier to solve.
This reduced problem may then be passed to an
appropriate solver.  Once the reduced problem has been solved, it is
then a restored to recover the solution for the original formulation.

**Currently only the options and inform dictionaries are exposed**; these are 
provided and used by other GALAHAD packages with Python interfaces.

See Section 4 of $GALAHAD/doc/presolve.pdf for a brief description of the
method employed and other details.

functions
---------

   .. function:: presolve.initialize()

      Set default option values and initialize private data.

      **Returns:**

      options : dict
        dictionary containing default control options:
          termination : int
             Determines the strategy for terminating the presolve
             analysis. Possible values are:

             * **1** 

               presolving is continued as long as one of  the sizes
               of the problem (n, m, a_ne, or h_ne) is being reduced;

             * **2** 

               presolving is continued as long as problem
               transformations remain possible. NOTE: the maximum number
               of analysis passes (control.max_nbr_passes) and the
               maximum number of problem transformations
               (control.max_nbr_transforms) set an upper limit on the
               presolving effort irrespective of the choice of
               control.termination. The only effect of this latter
               parameter is to allow for early termination.
          max_nbr_transforms : int
             The maximum number of problem transformations, cumulated
             over all calls to \p presolve.
          max_nbr_passes : int
             The maximum number of analysis passes for problem analysis
             during a single call of \p presolve_transform_problem.
          c_accuracy : float
             The relative accuracy at which the general linear
             constraints are satisfied at the exit of the solver. Note
             that this value is not used before the restoration of the
             problem.
          z_accuracy : float
             The relative accuracy at which the dual feasibility
             constraints are satisfied at the exit of the solver. Note
             that this value is not used before the restoration of the
             problem.
          infinity : float
             The value beyond which a number is deemed equal to plus
             infinity (minus infinity being defined as its opposite).
          out : int
             The unit number associated with the device used for
             printout.
          errout : int
             The unit number associated with the device used for error
             ouput.
          print_level : int
             The level of printout requested by the user. Can take the
             values:

             * **<=0** 

               no printout is produced

             * **1** 

               only reports the major steps in the analysis

             * **2** 

               reports the identity of each problem  transformation

             * **3** 

               reports more details

             * **4** 

               reports lots of information.

             * **>=5** 

               reports a completely silly amount of information.
          dual_transformations : bool
             True if dual transformations of the problem are allowed.
             Note that this implies that the reduced problem is solved
             accurately (for the dual feasibility condition to hold) as
             to be able to restore the problem to the original
             constraints and variables. False prevents dual
             transformations to be applied, thus allowing for inexact
             solution of the reduced problem. The setting of this
             control parameter overides that of get_z, get_z_bounds,
             get_y, get_y_bounds, dual_constraints_freq,
             singleton_columns_freq, doubleton_columns_freq,
             z_accuracy, check_dual_feasibility.
          redundant_xc : bool
             True if the redundant variables and constraints (i.e.
             variables that do not appear in the objective function and
             appear with a consistent sign in the constraints) are to
             be removed with their associated constraints before other
             transformations are attempted.
          primal_constraints_freq : int
             The frequency of primal constraints analysis in terms of
             presolving passes. A value of j = 2 indicates that primal
             constraints are analyzed every 2 presolving passes. A zero
             value indicates that they are never analyzed.
          dual_constraints_freq : int
             The frequency of dual constraints analysis in terms of
             presolving passes. A value of j = 2 indicates that dual
             constraints are analyzed every 2 presolving passes. A zero
             value indicates that they are never analyzed.
          singleton_columns_freq : int
             The frequency of singleton column analysis in terms of
             presolving passes. A value of j = 2 indicates that
             singleton columns are analyzed every 2 presolving passes.
             A zero value indicates that they are never analyzed.
          doubleton_columns_freq : int
             The frequency of doubleton column analysis in terms of
             presolving passes. A value of j indicates that doubleton
             columns are analyzed every 2 presolving passes. A zero
             value indicates that they are never analyzed.
          unc_variables_freq : int
             The frequency of the attempts to fix linearly
             unconstrained variables, expressed in terms of presolving
             passes. A value of j = 2 indicates that attempts are made
             every 2 presolving passes. A zero value indicates that no
             attempt is ever made.
          dependent_variables_freq : int
             The frequency of search for dependent variables in terms
             of presolving passes. A value of j = 2 indicates that
             dependent variables are searched for every 2 presolving
             passes. A zero value indicates that they are never
             searched for.
          sparsify_rows_freq : int
             The frequency of the attempts to make A sparser in terms
             of presolving passes. A value of j = 2 indicates that
             attempts are made every 2 presolving passes. A zero value
             indicates that no attempt is ever made.
          max_fill : int
             The maximum percentage of fill in each row of A. Note that
             this is a row-wise measure: globally fill never exceeds
             the storage initially used for A, no matter how large
             control.max_fill is chosen. If max_fill is negative, no
             limit is put on row fill.
          transf_file_nbr : int
             The unit number to be associated with the file(s) used for
             saving problem transformations on a disk file.
          transf_buffer_size : int
             The number of transformations that can be kept in memory
             at once (that is without being saved on a disk file).
          transf_file_status : int
             The exit status of the file where problem transformations
             are saved:

             * **0** 

               the file is not deleted after program termination

             * **1** 

               the file is not deleted after program termination.
          transf_file_name : str
             The name of the file (to be) used for storing problem
             transformation on disk. NOTE: this parameter must be
             identical for all calls to \p presolve following \p
             presolve_read_specfile. It can then only be changed after
             calling presolve_terminate.
          y_sign : int
             Determines the convention of sign used for the multipliers
             associated with the general linear constraints.

             * **1** 

               All multipliers corresponding to active  inequality
               constraints are non-negative for  lower bound constraints

             * **-1** 

               All multipliers corresponding to active  inequality
               constraints are non-positive for  lower bound constraints
               and non-negative for  upper bounds constraints.
          inactive_y : int
             Determines whether or not the multipliers corresponding to
             constraints that are inactive at the unreduced point
             corresponding to the reduced point on input to \p
             presolve_restore_solution must be set to zero. Possible
             values are: associated with the general linear
             constraints.

             * **0** 

               All multipliers corresponding to inactive  inequality
               constraints are forced to zero,  possibly at the expense
               of deteriorating the  dual feasibility condition.

             * **1** 

               Multipliers corresponding to inactive  inequality
               constraints are left unaltered.
          z_sign : int
             Determines the convention of sign used for the dual
             variables associated with the bound constraints.

             * **1** 

               All dual variables corresponding to  active lower
               bounds are non-negative, and  non-positive for active
               upper bounds.

             * **-1** 

               All dual variables corresponding to  active lower
               bounds are non-positive, and  non-negative for active
               upper bounds.
          inactive_z : int
             Determines whether or not the dual variables corresponding
             to bounds that are inactive at the unreduced point
             corresponding to the reduced point on input to
             presolve_restore_solution must be set to zero. Possible
             values are: associated with the general linear
             constraints.

             * **0** 

               All dual variables corresponding to  inactive bounds
               are forced to zero,  possibly at the expense of
               deteriorating the  dual feasibility condition.

             * **1** 

               Dual variables corresponding to inactive  bounds are
               left unaltered.
          final_x_bounds : int
             The type of final bounds on the variables returned by the
             package. This parameter can take the values:

             * **0** 

               the final bounds are the tightest bounds  known on the
               variables (at the risk of  being redundant with other
               constraints,  which may cause degeneracy);

             * **1** 

               the best known bounds that are known to  be
               non-degenerate. This option implies  that an additional
               real workspace of size  2 * n must be allocated.

             * **2** 

               the loosest bounds that are known to  keep the problem
               equivalent to the  original problem. This option also
               implies that an additional real  workspace of size 2 * n
               must be  allocated.  NOTE: this parameter must be
               identical for all calls to presolve (except
               presolve_initialize).
          final_z_bounds : int
             The type of final bounds on the dual variables returned by
             the package. This parameter can take the values:

               dual variables (at the risk  of being redundant with other
               constraints,  which may cause degeneracy);

             * **1**

               the best known bounds that are known to  be
               non-degenerate. This option implies  that an additional

             * **2**

               the loosest bounds that are known to  keep the problem
               equivalent to the  original problem. This option also
               implies that an additional real  workspace of size 2 * n
               
             must be allocated.  NOTE: this parameter must be identical
             for all calls to presolve (except presolve_initialize).
          final_c_bounds : int
             The type of final bounds on the constraints returned by
             the package. This parameter can take the values:

             * **0**

               the final bounds are the tightest bounds  known on the
               constraints (at the risk of  being redundant with other
               constraints,  which may cause degeneracy);

             * **1**

               non-degenerate. This option implies  that an additional
               real workspace of size  2 * m must be allocated.

             * **2**

               the loosest bounds that are known to  keep the problem
               equivalent to the  original problem. This option also
               implies that an additional real  workspace of size 2 * n
               must be  allocated.  NOTES: 1) This parameter must be
               identical for all calls to presolve (except
               presolve_initialize). 2) If different from 0, its value
               must be identical to that of control.final_x_bounds.
          final_y_bounds : int
             The type of final bounds on the multipliers returned by
             the package. This parameter can take the values:

             * **0**
               the final bounds are the tightest bounds  known on the
               multipliers (at the risk of  being redundant with other
               constraints,  which may cause degeneracy);

             * **1**
               the best known bounds that are known to  be
               non-degenerate. This option implies  that an additional
               real workspace of size  2 * m must be allocated.

             * **2**

               the loosest bounds that are known to  keep the problem
               equivalent to the  original problem. This option also
               implies that an additional real  workspace of size 2 * n
               must be  allocated.  NOTE: this parameter must be
               identical for all calls to presolve (except
               presolve_initialize).
          check_primal_feasibility : int
             The level of feasibility check (on the values of x) at the
             start of the restoration phase. This parameter can take
             the values:

             * **0**

               no check at all;

             * **1**

               the primal constraints are recomputed at x  and a
               message issued if the computed value  does not match the
               input value, or if it is  out of bounds (if
               control.print_level >= 2);

             * **2**

               the same as for 1, but presolve is  terminated if an
               incompatibilty is detected.
          check_dual_feasibility : int
             The level of dual feasibility check (on the values of x, y
             and z) at the start of the restoration phase. This
             parameter can take the values:

             * **0**

               no check at all;

             * **1**

               the dual feasibility condition is recomputed  at ( x,
               y, z ) and a message issued if the  computed value does
               not match the input value  (if control.print_level >= 2);

             * **2**

               the same as for 1, but presolve is  terminated if an
               incompatibilty is detected.  The last two values imply the
               allocation of an additional  real workspace vector of size
               equal to the number of  variables in the reduced problem.
          pivot_tol : float
             The relative pivot tolerance above which pivoting is
             considered as numerically stable in transforming the
             coefficient matrix A. A zero value corresponds to a
             totally unsafeguarded pivoting strategy (potentially
             unstable).
          min_rel_improve : float
             The minimum relative improvement in the bounds on x, y and
             z for a tighter bound on these quantities to be accepted
             in the course of the analysis. More formally, if lower is
             the current value of the lower bound on one of the x, y or
             z, and if new_lower is a tentative tighter lower bound on
             the same quantity, it is only accepted if   new_lower >=
             lower + tol * MAX( 1, ABS( lower ) ),  where  tol =
             control.min_rel_improve.  Similarly, a tentative tighter
             upper bound new_upper only replaces the current upper
             bound upper if   new_upper <= upper - tol * MAX( 1, ABS(
             upper ) ).  Note that this parameter must exceed the
             machine precision significantly.
          max_growth_factor : float
             The maximum growth factor (in absolute value) that is
             accepted between the maximum data item in the original
             problem and any data item in the reduced problem. If a
             transformation results in this bound being exceeded, the
             transformation is skipped.

   .. function:: [optional] presolve.information()

      Provide optional output information.

      **Returns:**

      inform : dict
         dictionary containing output information:
          status : int
            The presolve exit condition. It can take the following
            values (symbol in parentheses is the related Fortran
            code):

            *  **0** (OK)  

               successful exit;

            *  **1** (MAX_NBR_TRANSF)  

               the maximum number of problem
               transformation has been reached  NOTE:  this exit is not
               really an error, since the problem  can nevertheless be
               permuted and solved. It merely  signals that further
               problem reduction could possibly  be obtained with a
               larger value of the parameter
               control.max_nbr_transforms

            * **-1** (MEMORY_FULL)  

              memory allocation failed

              a file intended for saving problem
              transformations  could not be opened;

            * **-3** (COULD_NOT_WRITE)  

              an IO error occurred while saving
              transformations on  the relevant disk file;

              an integer contains less than NBRH + 1 bits.

            * **-21** (PRIMAL_INFEASIBLE)  

              the problem is primal infeasible;
