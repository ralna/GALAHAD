                status from the factorization package is given by
                inform['factor_status'].

              * **-10**

                The factorization failed; the return status from the
                factorization package is given by inform['factor_status'].

              * **-11**

                The solution of a set of linear equations using factors
                from the factorization package failed; the return status
                from the factorization package is given by

              * **-15**

                The preconditioner $S(x)$ appears not to be positive definite.

              * **-16**

                The problem is so ill-conditioned that further progress
                is impossible.

              * **-18**

                Too many iterations have been performed. This may happen if
                options['maxit'] is too small, but may also be symptomatic
                of a badly scaled problem.

              * **-19**

                The CPU time limit has been reached. This may happen if
                options['cpu_time_limit'] is too small, but may also be
                symptomatic of a badly scaled problem.

              * **-82**
