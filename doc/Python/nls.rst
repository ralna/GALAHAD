.. module:: galahad.nls

The nls package uses a regularization method to find a (local) unconstrained
minimizer of a differentiable weighted sum-of-squares objective function
$$\mathbf{f(x) :=
   \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^m w_i c_i^2(x) \equiv rac{1}{2} \|c(x)\|^2_W}$$
of many variables $f{x}$ involving positive weights $w_i$, $i=1,\ldots,m$.
The method offers the choice of direct and iterative solution of the key
regularization subproblems, and is most suitable for large problems.
First derivatives of the residual function $c(x)$ are required, and if
second derivatives of the $c_i(x)$ can be calculated, they may be exploited.

See Section 4 of $GALAHAD/doc/nls.pdf for a brief description of the
method employed and other details.

matrix storage
--------------

The symmetric $n$ by $n$ matrix $H = \nabla^2_{xx}f$ may
be presented and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry
is exploited by only storing values from the lower triangular part
(i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

Dense storage format:
The matrix $H$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that
is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order
within an appropriate real one-dimensional array. Since $H$ is
symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
$H_{ij}$ for $0 <= j <= i <= n-1$) need be held.
In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
component $i * i / 2 + j$  of the storage array H_val
will hold the value $H_{ij}$ (and, by symmetry, $H_{ji}$)
for $0 <= j <= i <= n-1$.

Sparse co-ordinate storage format:
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
For the $l$-th entry, $0 <= l <= ne-1$, of $H$,
its row index i, column index j and value $H_{ij}$,
$0 <= j <= i <= n-1$,  are stored as the $l$-th
components of the integer arrays H_row and H_col and real array H_val,
respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as
H_ne = $ne$. Note that only the entries in the lower triangle
should be stored.

Sparse row-wise storage format:
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
in row i+1. For the i-th row of $H$ the i-th component of the
integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices j, $0 <= j <= i$, and values
$H_{ij}$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
l = H_ptr(i), ..., H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the
integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively. Note that
as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored. For
sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
its predecessor.
