# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
# import os
# import sys
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

# There are two options for replacing |today|: either, you set today to some
# non-false value, then it is used:
#today = '21 July 2022'
# Else, today_fmt is used as the format for a strftime call.

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# You can specify multiple suffix as a list of string:
#
# source_suffix = ['.rst', '.md']

# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.

# documentation.
#

# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
