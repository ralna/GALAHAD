L2RT
====

.. module:: galahad.l2rt

The ``l2rt`` package uses a **Krylov-subspace iteration** to find an 
approximation of the global minimizer of the 
**regularized linear Euclidean-norm objective function**. 
The aim is to minimize the objective function
$$r(x) = \sqrt{\|Ax - b\|_2^2 + \mu \|x\|_2^2} + \frac{\sigma}{p} \|x\|_2^p,$$ 
where the $\ell_2$-norm of $x$ is defined to be $\|x\|_2 = \sqrt{x^T x}$,
and where the **shift** $\mu \geq 0$, **weight** $\sigma > 0$ and 
**power** $p \geq 2$.
The method may be suitable for large problems as no factorization is
required. Reverse communication is used to obtain
matrix-vector products of the form $u + A v$ and $v + A^T u.$

See Section 4 of $GALAHAD/doc/l2rt.pdf for a brief description of the
method employed and other details.
