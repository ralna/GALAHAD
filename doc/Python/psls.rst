   .. function:: psls.initialize()

      Set default option values and initialize private data

      **Returns:**

      options : dict
        dictionary containing default control options:
          error : int
             error and warning diagnostics occur on stream error.
          warning : int
             unit for warning messages.
          out : int
             general output occurs on stream out.

             unit for statistical output.

             Possible values are

             * **<=0**

               gives no output.

             * **1**

               gives a summary of the process.

             * **>=2**

               gives increasingly verbose (debugging) output.

          preconditioner : int
             which preconditioner to use. Possible values are:

             * **<0**

               no preconditioning occurs, $P = I$.

             * **0**

               the preconditioner is chosen automatically
               (forthcoming, and currently defaults to 1).

             * **1**

               $A$ is replaced by the diagonal,  $P$ = diag( max(
               $A$, ``min_diagonal`` ) ).

             * **2**

               $A$ is replaced by the band  $P$ = band( $A$ ) with
               semi-bandwidth ``semi_bandwidth.``

             * **3**

               $A$ is replaced by the reordered band  $P$ = band(
               order( $A$ ) ) with semi-bandwidth  ``semi_bandwidth,``
               where order is chosen by the HSL package  MC61 to move
               entries closer to the diagonal.

             * **4**

               $P$ is a full factorization of $A$ using
               Schnabel-Eskow  modifications, in which small or negative
               diagonals are  made sensibly positive during the factorization.

             * **5**

               $P$ is a full factorization of $A$ due to Gill,
               Murray,  Ponceleon and Saunders, in which an indefinite
               factorization  is altered to give a positive definite one.

             * **6**

               $P$ is an incomplete Cholesky factorization of $A$
               using  the package ICFS due to Lin and More'.

             * **7**

               $P$ is an incomplete factorization of $A$ implemented
               as HSL_MI28 from HSL.

             * **8**

               $P$ is an incomplete factorization of $A$ due  to
               Munskgaard (forthcoming).

             * **>8**

               treated as 0.  

             Options 3-8 may require
             additional external software that is not part of the
             package, and that must be obtained separately.
          semi_bandwidth : int
             the semi-bandwidth for band(H) when ``preconditioner`` =
             2,3.
          scaling : int
             not used at present.
          ordering : int
             see scaling.
          max_col : int
             maximum number of nonzeros in a column of $A$ for
             Schur-complement factorization to accommodate newly
             deleted rpws and columns.
          icfs_vectors : int
             number of extra vectors of length n required by the
             Lin-More' incomplete Cholesky preconditioner when
             ``preconditioner`` = 6.
          mi28_lsize : int
             the maximum number of fill entries within each column of
             the incomplete factor L computed by HSL_MI28 when
             ``preconditioner`` = 7. In general, increasing mi28_lsize
             improve the quality of the preconditioner but increases
             the time to compute and then apply the preconditioner.
             Values less than 0 are treated as 0.
          mi28_rsize : int
             the maximum number of entries within each column of the
             strictly lower triangular matrix $R$ used in the
             computation of the preconditioner by HSL_MI28 when
             ``preconditioner`` = 7. Rank-1 arrays of size
             ``mi28_rsize`` * n are allocated internally to hold $R$.
             Thus the amount of memory used, as well as the amount of
             work involved in computing the preconditioner, depends on
             mi28_rsize. Setting mi28_rsize > 0 generally leads to a
             higher quality preconditioner than using mi28_rsize = 0,
             and choosing mi28_rsize >= mi28_lsize is generally
             recommended.
          min_diagonal : float
             the minimum permitted diagonal in
             diag(max(H,.min_diagonal)).
          new_structure : bool
             set new_structure True if the storage structure for the
             input matrix has changed, and False if only the values
             have changed.
          get_semi_bandwidth : bool
             set get_semi_bandwidth True if the semi-bandwidth of the
             submatrix is to be calculated.
          get_norm_residual : bool
             set get_norm_residual True if the residual when applying
             the preconditioner are to be calculated.
          space_critical : bool
             if ``space_critical`` is True, every effort will be made to
             use as little space as possible. This may result in longer
             computation time.
          deallocate_error_fatal : bool
             if ``deallocate_error_fatal`` is True, any array/pointer
             deallocation error will terminate execution. Otherwise,
             computation will continue.
          definite_linear_solver : str
             the definite linear equation solver used when
             ``preconditioner`` = 3,4. Possible choices are currently:
             sils, ma27, ma57, ma77, ma86, ma87, ma97, ssids, mumps, pardiso,
             mkl_pardiso, pastix, wsmp, potr and pbtr, although only sils,
             potr, pbtr and, for OMP 4.0-compliant compilers, ssids are
             installed by default.
          prefix : str
            all output lines will be prefixed by the string contained
            in quotes within ``prefix``, e.g. 'word' (note the qutoes)
            will result in the prefix word.

          mi28_options : dict
             default control options for HSL_MI28 (see ``mi28.initialize``).
