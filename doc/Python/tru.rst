.. module:: galahad.tru

The tru package uses a trust-region method to find a (local)
minimizer of a differentiable objective function $f(x)$ of
many variables $x$. The method offers the choice of direct
and iterative solution of the key subproblems, and is most
suitable for large problems. First derivatives are required, and
if second derivatives can be calculated, they will be exploited.

See Section 4 of $GALAHAD/doc/tru.pdf for a brief description of the
method employed and other details.

matrix storage
--------------

The symmetric $n$ by $n$ matrix $H = \nabla^2_{xx}f$ may
be presented and stored in a variety of formats. But crucially symmetry
is exploited by only storing values from the lower triangular part
(i.e, those entries that lie on or below the leading diagonal).

Dense storage format:
The matrix $H$ is stored as a compact  dense matrix by rows, that
is, the values of the entries of each row in turn are stored in order
within an appropriate real one-dimensional array. Since $H$ is
symmetric, only the lower triangular part (that is the part
$H_{ij}$ for $0 <= j <= i <= n-1$) need be held.
In this case the lower triangle should be stored by rows, that is
component $i * i / 2 + j$  of the storage array H_val
will hold the value $H_{ij}$ (and, by symmetry, $H_{ji}$)
for $0 <= j <= i <= n-1$.

Sparse co-ordinate storage format:
Only the nonzero entries of the matrices are stored.
For the $l$-th entry, $0 <= l <= ne-1$, of $H$,
its row index i, column index j and value $H_{ij}$,
$0 <= j <= i <= n-1$,  are stored as the $l$-th
components of the integer arrays H_row and H_col and real array H_val,
respectively, while the number of nonzeros is recorded as
H_ne = $ne$. Note that only the entries in the lower triangle
should be stored.

Sparse row-wise storage format:
Again only the nonzero entries are stored, but this time
they are ordered so that those in row i appear directly before those
in row i+1. For the i-th row of $H$ the i-th component of the
integer array H_ptr holds the position of the first entry in this row,
while H_ptr(n) holds the total number of entries plus one.
The column indices j, $0 <= j <= i$, and values
$H_{ij}$ of the  entries in the i-th row are stored in components
l = H_ptr(i), ..., H_ptr(i+1)-1 of the
integer array H_col, and real array H_val, respectively. Note that
as before only the entries in the lower triangle should be stored. For
sparse matrices, this scheme almost always requires less storage than
its predecessor.

              expanding band of Hessian (*not yet implemented*).

          semi_bandwidth : int
            specify the semi-bandwidth of the band matrix $P$ if required.
          lbfgs_vectors : int
            number of vectors used by the L-BFGS matrix $P$ if required.
          max_dxg : int
            number of vectors used by the sparsity-based secant Hessian

          icfs_vectors : int
            number of vectors used by the Lin-More' incomplete
            factorization matrix $P$ if required.
          mi28_lsize : int
            the maximum number of fill entries within each column of the
            incomplete factor L computed by HSL_MI28. In general,
            increasing ``mi28_lsize`` improve the quality of the
            preconditioner but increases the time to compute and then
            apply the preconditioner. Values less than 0 are treated as 0.
          mi28_rsize : int
            the maximum number of entries within each column of the
            strictly lower triangular matrix $R$ used in the computation
            of the preconditioner by HSL_MI28. Rank-1 arrays of size
            ``mi28_rsize`` * n are allocated internally to hold $R$. Thus
            the amount of memory used, as well as the amount of work
            involved in computing the preconditioner, depends on
            ``mi28_rsize.`` Setting ``mi28_rsize`` > 0 generally leads to
            a higher quality preconditioner than using ``mi28_rsize`` =
            0, and choosing ``mi28_rsize`` >= ``mi28_lsize`` is generally
            recommended.
          advanced_start : int
             try to pick a good initial trust-region radius using
             ``advanced_start`` iterates of a variant on the strategy

          stop_g_absolute : float
            overall convergence tolerances. The iteration will terminate
            when the norm of the gradient of the objective function is
            smaller than MAX( ``stop_g_absolute,`` ``stop_g_relative``
            * norm of the initial gradient ) or if the step is less than
            ``stop_s``.

          stop_s : float
            see stop_g_absolute.

            initial value for the trust-region radius.
          maximum_radius : float
            maximum permitted trust-region radius.
          eta_successful : float
            a potential iterate will only be accepted if the actual
            decrease f - f(x_new) is larger than ``eta_successful`` times
            that predicted by a quadratic model of the decrease. The
            trust-region radius will be increased if this relative
            decrease is greater than ``eta_very_successful`` but smaller
            than ``eta_too_successful``.
          eta_very_successful : float
            see eta_successful.
          eta_too_successful : float
            see eta_successful.
          radius_increase : float
            on very successful iterations, the trust-region radius will
            be increased the factor ``radius_increase,`` while if the
            iteration is unsucceful, the radius will be decreased by a
            factor ``radius_reduce`` but no more than
            ``radius_reduce_max``.
          radius_reduce : float
            see radius_increase.
          radius_reduce_max : float
            see radius_increase.
          obj_unbounded : float
            the smallest value the objective function may take before the
            problem is marked as unbounded.
          cpu_time_limit : float

          space_critical : bool
            if ``space_critical`` True, every effort will be made to use
