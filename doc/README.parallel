From Version 2.4, GALAHAD offers limited support for
parallel execution for shared-memory multiprocessing systems
using OPENMP. Primarily paralleism is used by HSL and other
linear equation solvers and via LAPACK and the BLAS.

If you have a multi-processing system, try setting the
environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to an integer larger
than 1 to see if you get speed (elapsed, not CPU time) imprvements.
Increasing OMP_NUM_THREADS beyond the number of processors is unlikely
to be beneficial.
