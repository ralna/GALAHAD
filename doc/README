In order to get GALAHAD working, here is what you need to do.

    ===========
    PREPARATION
    ===========

[-1. If you are hoping for advice about installing GALAHAD
   under Windows, see README.windows. If this isn't what you wanted,
   try Dilipan Sebastiampillai's document lanb2win.pdf.]

0. You will definitely need the package auxiliary package ARCHDefs.
   If you plan to use GALAHAD to solve problems written as .SIF
   files, you will also need the package SiFDec. If, in addition,
   you plan to use the CUTEst interfaces to the GALAHAD FILTRANE, QP,
   least-squares, regularization and/or unconstrained minimization routines,
   you will also need the package CUTEst. See

     https://github.com/ralna/CUTEst/wiki

   for details of how to obtain these. CUTEst is not necessary if you simply
   wish to use LANCELOT B to solve problems written as .SIF files.

   You should download the necessary packages ARCHDefs, SIFDecode and
   CUTEst as described in the above Wiki, and set the environment variables
   $ARCHDEFS, $SIFDECODE and $CUTEST as described - (see steps 0 and 1 in the
   README that comes with SIFDecode/CUTEst for more details - i.e.,

   for the C shell (csh):

    setenv ARCHDEFS [full path to ./archdefs directory]
    setenv SIFDECODE [full path to ./sifdecode directory]
    setenv CUTEST [full path to ./cutest directory]

   for the bourne again shell (bash)

    export ARCHDEFS=[full path to ./archdefs directory]
    export SIFDECODE=[full path to ./sifdecode directory]
    export CUTEST=[full path to ./cutest directory]

   ** NOTE THAT YOU DO NOT NEED TO INSTALL THESE PACKAGES, AS THE GALAHAD
      INSTALLATION WILL DO THIS FOR YOU IN A PROPERLY-INTEGRATED WAY **

   If you plan to use the AMPL interface, you must have installed a working
   version of the AMPL interface library, see

     ftp://netlib.bell-labs.com/netlib/ampl/solvers.tar

   This is not needed if you simply wish to use the GALAHAD packages
   stand-alone or via the CUTEst/SIF interface.

[ 1. Do yourself a favour ... get GNU make:

      http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html !

   GALAHAD is designed to be installed by any variant of the make
   program that we are aware of, but such are the incompatibilities
   introduced by different vendors, we cannot be sure that make
   will work properly on your system. However, if you have
   GNU make (sometimes known as gmake), we have high confidence that
   your installation will be trouble free. Fortunately GNU make is the
   defualt version of make available with most modern operating systems]

2. Put the file

     galahad.tar.gz

   in a suitable directory for which the ./galahad
   directory will be a sub-directory.

3. Issue the command

     tar xzvf galahad.tar.gz

4. Set the environment variable GALAHAD to point at the
   ./galahad directory, i.e.,

   for the C shell (csh):

    setenv GALAHAD [full path to ./galahad directory]

   for the bourne again shell (bash)

    export GALAHAD=[full path to ./galahad directory]

   Make this a permanent setting by inserting this command
   in your in your .cshrc/.bashrc file (or whichever shell resource file
   is appropriate for you) and "source" the file. See
   ./galahad/doc/README.cshrc and ./galahad/doc/README.bashrc for
   more details.

5. You should also dowload a subset of the HSL Archive packages, ad02,
   ma27 and ma33, needed by GALAHAD. This is *NOT* open source software,
   but the packages are availble as a bundle, WITHOUT CHARGE, by
   registering at

     http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/download/hslarchive-galahad/latest

   You will need to provide a valid email address, and once you have
   registered you will be sent an email message providing a link
   to the software as a file in either zip or tar.gz format.

   Once you have downloaded this file, it should be uncompressed
   in the directory ./  (The destination can be changed by editing the
   environment variable $HSL_ARCHIVE in the file

     $GALAHAD/src/makedefs/packages.default

   see 8 below.)

6. If you are intending to use the AMPL interface, set the environment
   variable AMPLDIR to point to the directory in which you have installed
   the AMPL interface library i.e.,

    setenv AMPLDIR [full path to the AMPL interface library directory]

   for the bourne again shell (bash)

    export AMPLDIR=[full path to the AMPL interface library directory]

   Make this a permanent setting by inserting this command
   in your in your .cshrc/.bashrc file (or whichever shell resource file
   is appropriate for you) and "source" the file. Again, see
   ./galahad/doc/README.cshrc and ./galahad/doc/README.bashrc for
   more details.

   [ -*-NB-*- If you plan to use AMPL with the Lahey lf95, Fujistu frt or
      Intel ifort compiler, change

      extern void MAIN__( VOID );

    to

      extern int MAIN__( int, char** );

    ( *note* the double underscore)

    somewhere around line 790 in $AMPLDIR/asl.h, as otherwise there will be
    clashes between GALAHAD and AMPL C interfaces ]

7. Add the directory

     $GALAHAD/bin

   to your search path (preferably in your .cshrc or similar
   file) so that you will be able to use the GALAHAD/CUTEst
   interfaces. Again, see ./galahad/doc/README.cshrc or
   ./galahad/doc/README.bashrc for more details.

8. On installation the file

     $GALAHAD/src/makedefs/packages.default

    will be copied to

     $GALAHAD/src/makedefs/packages

   Before installation, you can examine (and edit if you wish) the
   file to see how you might provide the source code for additional
   external third-party packages, and to find instructions on how to
   get them and where to put them.

   ================ IMPORTANT NEWS FOR POTENTIAL HSL USERS ==============

   All the optional HSL software used by GALAHAD is available as a single
   tar.gz or gzip file. These files may be DOWNLOADED WITHOUT CHARGE FOR
   PERSONAL USE by any academic with a recognised academic email address.
   See

       http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/download/hsl-galahad/latest/d/

   (or  http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/download/hsl-galahad/latest/s/ for a
   single precision version) for registration details. Once you have
   registered you will be sent an email message providing a link
   to the software as a file in either zip or tar.gz format; there may
   be a delay in receiving the file, as it has to manually authorized
   by the HSL manager.

   Once you have downloaded this file, it should be uncompressed in a
   convenient location, and we recommend that you choose the directory ./
   The file ./galahad/src/makedefs/packages.default ** MUST BE EDITED **
   to activate the HSL packages.

   Once GALAHAD has been installed, any further changes to optional
   software should be recorded in the file ./galahad/src/makedefs/packages,
   and GALAHAD recompiled so that the changes take effect (see 13 below).

9. You may also optionally provide binary code for a number of external
   packages that might make GALAHAD run faster. These include the
   BLAS ((basic linear algebra subprograms), LAPACK, METIS, PARDISO and WSMP.
   Don't worry if you cannot provide thses; GALAHAD will compile non-optimised
   versions of the necessary ones (BLAS, LAPACK) and provide dummy versions
   of the others. See ./galahad/doc/README.external for more details.

10. If you plan to use the (limited) Matlab interfaces, make sure that
   the MATLAB environment variable points to your system Matlab directory,
   and that $GALAHAD/src/matlab is on your Matlab path. See README.matlab
   for more details.

11 If you are running on a Linux/OSX system, you may need to install the
   Open-MPI Portable Hardware Locality (HWLOC) development package

      https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/

   This is readily available in many Linux distributions, e.g., via

      sudo apt-get install libhwloc-dev

   on Debian/Ubuntu systems, or

      sudo rpm --install libhwloc-dev

   for Redhat ones. Check with your system administrator if you need help!

   If it *really* is impossible to install libhwloc-dev, you should edit
   the file $GALAHAD/src/spral/config.h and replace the line

   #define HAVE_HWLOC 1

   with

   #undef HAVE_HWLOC

   Alternatively, during the GALAHAD install (13 below), when you get to
   the prompt

     Would you like to review and modify the C compiler settings (y/N)?

   answer y, and change the variable HWLOC to read

     HWLOC='un'

   Currently this is done automatically for ifort/icc to avoid a compiler bug

12. For Windows systems that use MSYS/MINGW, you will also need to set the
   environment variable MSYS2 to point to the folder that contains the
   Unix-style shell and commands, and MINGW64 to the folder that holds
   ths commands relating to the GCC/Gfortran compilers. For example,

    export MSYS2="/usr"
    export MINGW64="/c/msys64/mingw64"

    ============
    INSTALLATION
    ============

13. To install GALAHAD for a particular machine/os/compiler
   combination, move into the $GALAHAD directory,
   issue the command

     $ARCHDEFS/install_optrove

   and answer the questions as prompted. This command sets up
   machine/os/compiler-specific files, and (optionally) compiles all
   (or suitable sub-components) of GALAHAD (and SiFDec/CUTEst if required).

   You may issue the $ARCHDEFS/install_optrove command for as many
   machine/os/compiler combinations as you wish to support, and you
   will have access to each independently of the others.

   On completion of the installation, please read the message that
   gives full details of environment variables that need to be set.

14. To recompile the whole of GALAHAD, move into the directory

     $GALAHAD/src

   and issue the command

     make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/#

   where # is a string of the form

      machine.os.compiler

   created during one of the installations described in 13 above.
   If you want the single-precision version, the appropriate command is

     make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# PRECIS=single

15. To recompile LANCELOT B, move into the directory

     $GALAHAD/src/

    and issue the command

     make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# lancelotb

    where # is as in 13 above. To recompile all the QP routines, or the
    individual packages QPA, QPB or PRESOLVE, the required commands are

     make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# qp
     make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# qpa
     make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# qpb
     make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# pre

    To recompile the FILTRANE package and its dependencies, the required
    command is

     make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# filtrane

    =========
    EXECUTION
    =========

16. To run the QP codes qpa/qpb/qpc on the CUTEst example EXAMPLE.SIF
   issue the command

     sdgal # qpa [other options] EXAMPLE[.SIF]

   or

     sdgal # qpa [other options] EXAMPLE[.SIF]

   or

     sdgal # qpc [other options] EXAMPLE[.SIF]

   where # is as in 14 above, from the directory containing the SIF file.

   To rerun the most recently decoded example, issue the command

     gal # qpa -n [other options]

   or

     gal # qpb -n [other options]

   See README.SIF for more details.

17. To run/rerun LANCELOT B on the CUTE example EXAMPLE.SIF
   issue the command

     sdgal # lancelot [other options] EXAMPLE[.SIF]

   where # is as in 14 above, from the directory containing the SIF file.

   To rerun the most recently decoded example, issue the command

     gal # lancelot [other options]

   See README.SIF for more details.

18. To run/rerun FILTRANE on the CUTE example EXAMPLE.SIF
   issue the command

     sdgal # filtrane [other options] EXAMPLE[.SIF]

   where # is as in 14 above, from the directory containing the SIF file.

   To rerun the most recently decoded example, issue the command

     gal # filtrane [other options]

   See README.SIF for more details.

    =======
    TESTING
    =======

19. To test that the installation of GALAHAD has been successful, you can
    move into the directory

      $GALAHAD/src

    and issue the command

      make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# test

    where # is as 14 above - for a single precision installation, the command is

      make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# test PRECIS=single

    To test LANCELOT, move into $GALAHAD/src/lanb , and issue the same
    command, to test the QP routines, do the same in the directory
    $GALAHAD/src/qp , and to test FILTRANE, do the same in the directory
    $GALAHAD/src/filtrane .

20. If you are not using CUTEst, the GALAHAD link library for the
    precision you compiled with is in $GALAHAD/objects/#/(precision)/
    where (precision) is double or single, and # is as above.
    You should add this to your LIBPATH environment variable,
    and may then link the library with the -lgalahad compiler flag.
    Access to optional auxiliary libraries is via
     -lgalahad_hsl -lgalahad_pardiso -lgalahad_wsmp -lgalahad_metis
     -lgalahad_lapack -lgalahad_blas
    as appropriate.

    =============
    DOCUMENTATION
    =============

21. Postscript documentation for each package is available in the
    directory $GALAHAD/doc . Man pages for sdgal and gal are in
    $GALAHAD/man/man1 . You may wish to add $GALAHAD/man to your
    MANPATH environment variable.

22. If you like using graphical user-interfaces, why not try the GALAHAD
     python GUI(see $GAHALAD/doc/README.gui for details). This has not
     been kept fully up to date, so is probably of limited use.
