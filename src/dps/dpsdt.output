 C sparse matrix indexing

 basic tests of storage formats

format C: DPS_solve_problem exit status   = 0, f = -0.04
format C: DPS_resolve_problem exit status = 0, f = 0.38
format R: DPS_solve_problem exit status   = 0, f = -0.04
format R: DPS_resolve_problem exit status = 0, f = 0.38
format D: DPS_solve_problem exit status   = 0, f = -0.04
format D: DPS_resolve_problem exit status = 0, f = 0.38
