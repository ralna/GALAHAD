 C sparse matrix indexing

 basic tests of storage formats

C: residual =   0.0e+00 status = 0
R: residual =   0.0e+00 status = 0
D: residual =   0.0e+00 status = 0
L: residual =   0.0e+00 status = 0
S: residual =   0.0e+00 status = 0
I: residual =   0.0e+00 status = 0
Z: residual =   0.0e+00 status = 0
