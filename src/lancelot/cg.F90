!  Find an approximation to the minimizer of the quadratic function

!     0.5 (X-X0) (transpose ) B (X-X0) + G (transpose) (X-X0) + F

!  within the box region BND(*,1) <= X(*) <= BND(*,2) subject to the further
!  restriction that specified variables remain fixed at their initial values

!  ** Version to allow restarts when bounds are encountered

!  Optionally, the search may be terminated at the first point encountered on
!  the boundary of the spherical region ||X - X0|| <= R, where ||.|| denotes
!  the 2-norm. Furthermore, the minimization may continue along the edges of
!  the box if so desired

!  Control is passed from the routine whenever a product of the vector P with
!  B is required, and the user is responsible for forming the product in the
!  vector Q. Control is also passed to the user when the 'preconditioned'
!  gradient W ** (-1) GRAD is to be formed in Q. Here, W is any positive
!  definite and symmetric approximation to the Hessian B

!  Progress through the routine is controlled by the parameter JUMPTO

!  If JUMPTO = 0, no further entry is called for
!  If JUMPTO = 1, an initial entry has been made
!  If JUMPTO = 2, the vector Q = W ** (-1) * GRAD is required
!  If JUMPTO = 3, the vector Q = B * P is required
!  If JUMPTO = 4, the norm of the gradient of the current iterate is smaller
!                 than epsgrd. The user may wish to perform additional
!                 convergence tests in the calling program and re-enter cg
!                 with a smaller value of EPSGRD. If such a re-entry is
!                 required, JUMPTO should not be altered. Otherwise, JUMPTO
!                 should be reset to 0
!  If JUMPTO = 5, an edge of the box has been encountered. If the user wishes
!                 to continue the minimization along the edge, JUMPTO should
!                 be reset to 2 and the the vector Q calculated as above
!                 before re-entry. Otherwise, JUMPTO should be reset to 0

!  The value of the array VARIABLE_status gives the status of the variables

!  IF VARIABLE_status( I ) = 0, the I-TH variable is free
!  IF VARIABLE_status( I ) = 1, the I-th variable is fixed on its lower bound
!  IF VARIABLE_status( I ) = 2, the I-th variable is fixed on its upper bound
!  IF VARIABLE_status( I ) = 3, the I-th variable is permanently fixed
!  IF VARIABLE_status( I ) = 4, the I-th variable is fixed at some other value

!  The addresses of the free variables are given in the first NVAR entries
!  of the array IVAR

!  If the product W ** (-1) * GRAD is required (JUMPTO = 2), the nonzero
!  components of GRAD occur in positions IVAR(I) for I lying between one and
!  NVAR and have the values GRAD(I)

!  If the product B * P is required (JUMPTO = 3), the nonzero components of P
!  occur in positions IVAR(I) for I lying between 1 and NVAR

!  THE PRECONDITIONER:

!  When JUMPTO = 2, the user is asked to provide the product of the inverse
!  of a 'preconditioning' matrix W and the vector GRAD. The matrix W should
!  have the following properties:

!  a) W must be symmetric and positive definite.
!  b) W should be an approximation to the second derivative matrix
!     B in the sense that the eigenvalues of W ** (-1) B should be close to
!     unity whenever B is positive definite. Ideally, these eigenvalues should
!     be clustered about a small number of distinct values.
!  c) W should have the property that the product W ** (-1) * GRAD is cheap to
!     obtain. By this we mean that the amount of arithmetic work involved in
!     forming the product should be a small multiple of N.

!  Popular preconditioners include the diagonal preconditioner, in which W is
!  a diagonal matrix with diagonal values equal to those of B (modified to be
!  positive if necessary) and the incomplete factorization preconditioner, in
!  which elements of B are changed to zeros in W in order to reduce the number
!  of nonzeros in the cholesky factorization of W. Unfortunately, the choice
!  of a good preconditioner is problem dependent

!  ------------------------- dummy arguments --------------------------

!  n      (INTEGER) the number of independent variables.
!          ** this variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  X0     (REAL array of length at least n) the point x0.
!          ** this variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  XT     (REAL array of length at least n) the current estimate
!          of the minimizer for the problem. XT should be initialized
!          at the user's estimate of the minimizer and must satisfy
!          the restriction BND(1,i) <= XT(i) <= BND(2,i), i=1,...,n
!  G      (REAL array of length at least n) the coefficients of
!          the linear term in the quadratic function
!          ** this variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  BND    (two dimensional REAL array with leading dimension nbnd and second
!          dimension 2) the lower (BND(*,1)) and upper (BND(*,2)) bounds on
!          the variables. ** this variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  nbnd   (INTEGER) leading dimension of BND
!         ** this variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  VARIABLE_status (INTEGER array of length at least n) specifies which
!          of the variables are to be fixed at the start of the minimization.
!          VARIABLE_status should be set as follows:
!          If VARIABLE_status( i ) = 0, the i-th variable is free
!          If VARIABLE_status( i ) = 1, the i-th variable is on its lower bound
!          If VARIABLE_status( i ) = 2, the i-th variable is on its upper bound
!          If VARIABLE_status( i ) = 3, 4, the i-th variable is fixed at XT(i)
!  epsgrd (REAL) the minimization will continue until the norm of the scaled
!          gradient is less than sqrt(epsgrd).
!          ** this variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  fmodel (REAL) the value of the quadratic function at the current
!          estimate of the minimizer. fmodel should be initialized at
!          the value of the quadratic at the initial point
!  XSCALE (REAL array of length n) the scale factors used in computing the
!          norm of the scaled gradient, gnorm =
!          SQRT( SUM(from i=1)(to nvar) (GRAD(i) * XSCALE(IVAR(i)))**2 ).
!          ** this variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  GRAD   (REAL array of length n) the value of nonzero components of the
!          gradient of the quadratic function at the current estimate of the
!          minimizer. The component GRAD(i), i = 1,.., nvar, gives the value
!          of the IVAR(I)-th component of the gradient of the quadratic
!          function (see IVAR, nvar)
!  status (INTEGER) the value of status on terminal (jumpto=0) exit
!          describes the progress of the algorithm as follows:
!          If status = 10, the output value XT contains the required
!                          minimizer (see epsgrd)
!          If status = 11, too many iterations have been performed
!                          by the routine without solving the problem.
!                          The best estimate of the solution is given in XT
!          If status = 12, a free variable has encountered one of its bounds,
!                          or the trust-region boundary has been encountered.
!                          The best estimate of the solution found to date is
!                          given in XT
!          If status = 13, a direction of negative curvature has been
!                          determined and a step to one of the bounds has been
!                          taken. The best estimate of the solution obtained
!                          is given in XT
!          If status = 14, the last step taken is so small that further
!                          progress is unlikely. The best estimate of the
!                          solution is given in XT
!          If status = 15, the preconditioner does not appear to be 
!                          positive definite. The best estimate of the
!                          solution is given in XT
!  P      (REAL array of length at least n) contains the values of the
!          components of the vector P. On an initial entry (jumpto=1),
!          the components of P must be set to zero. On a non optimal exit
!          (jumpto=3), P is the vector for which the product B*P is
!          required before the next re-entry. The components IVAR(i),
!          i = 1, ... , nvar of P contain the values of the nonzero components
!          of P (see, IVAR, nvar)
!  Q      (REAL array of length at least n) on the initial entry (jumpto=1),
!          Q must contain the product B * ( XT - X0 ). Q must contain the
!          vector W ** (-1) * GRAD (jumpto=2) or B * P (jumpto=3), on a non
!          initial entry. For non initial entries, only the components with
!          indices IVAR(i) i=1,..,nvar need be set (the other components are
!          not used)
!  IVAR   (INTEGER array of length at least n) on all normal exits
!         (jumpto=0,2,3), IVAR(i), i=1,...,nvar, gives the indices of the
!          nonzero components of P and GRAD
!  nvar   (INTEGER) see IVAR, above
!  nresrt (INTEGER) the search for the minimizer will be restarted in
!          the preconditioned steepest-descent direction every nresrt
!          iterations. ** this variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  twonrm (LOGICAL) the search for the minimizer will be terminated on the
!          boundary of the spherical (2-norm) region ||X-X0||_2 <= R if and 
!          only if twonrm is set to .TRUE. on initial (jumpto=1) entry.
!          ** this variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  r      (REAL) the radius, R, of the spherical region. r need not be
!          set if twonrm is .FALSE. on initial entry.
!          ** This variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  nobnds (LOGICAL) there are no bounds on the variables.
!          ** this variable is not altered by the subroutine

!          estimate of the minimizer
!  dxsqr  (REAL) the square of the two norm of the distance between the
!          current estimate of the minimizer and X0. dxsqr will only be set if
!          twonrm is .TRUE.
!  iout   (INTEGER) the standard fortran output unit to be used
!  jumpto (INTEGER) controls flow through the subroutine.
!          If jumpto = 0, no further entry is called for
!          If jumpto = 1, an initial entry has been made
!          If jumpto = 2, the vector Q = W ** (-1) GRAD is required
!          If jumpto = 3, the vector Q = B * P is required
!          If jumpto = 4, the norm of the gradient of the current iterate is
!                         smaller than epsgrd. The user may wish to perform
!                         additional convergence tests in the calling program
!                         and re-enter CG with a smaller value of epsgrd. If
!                         such a re-entry is required, jumpto should not be
!                         altered. Otherwise, jumpto should be reset to 0
!          If jumpto = 5, an edge of the box has been encountered. If the
!                         user wishes to continue the minimization along the
!                         edge, jumpto should be reset to 2 and the the vector
!                         Q calculated as above before re-entry. Otherwise,
!                         jumpto should be reset to 0
!  idebug (INTEGER) allows detailed printing. if idebug is larger than 4,
!          detailed output from the routine will be given. Otherwise, no
!          output occurs
!  findmx (REAL) when printing the value of the objective function,
!          the value calculated in fmodel will be multiplied by the
!          scale factor findmx. This allows the user, for instance,
!          to find the maximum of a quadratic function F, by minimizing
!          the function - F, while monitoring the progress as
!          if a maximization were actually taking place, by setting
!          findmx to - 1.0. Normally findmx should be set to 1.0
!  itercg (INTEGER) gives the number of conjugate gradient iterations taken
!  itcgmx (INTEGER) gives the maximum number of conjugate gradient 
!         iterations permitted
!  ifixed (INTEGER) gives the variable which most recently hits a bound

!  RE-ENTRY:

!  If the variable JUMPTO has the value 2 on exit, the

!  If the variable JUMPTO has the value 3 on exit, the
