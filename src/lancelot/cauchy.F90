!  Find the Generalized Cauchy Point (GCP) in the direction D from X0
!  for a given quadratic function within a box shaped region

!  If we define the 'Cauchy arc' X(t) = projection of X0 + t*P into the box
!  region BND(*,1) <= X(*) <= BND(*,2), the GCP is the first local minimizer
!  of the quadratic function

!     0.5 (X-X0) (transpose ) B (X-X0) + G (transpose) (X-X0) + F

!  for points lying on X(t), with 0 <= t <= tmax. Optionally, the search for the
!  GCP may be terminated at the first point encountered on the boundary of the
!  spherical region ||X - X0|| <= R, where ||.|| denotes the 2-norm.
!  Control is passed from the routine whenever a product of the vector P with
!  B is required, and the user is responsible for forming the product in the
!  vector Q

!  Progress through the routine is controlled by the parameter JUMPTO

!  If JUMPTO = 0, the GCP has been found
!  If JUMPTO = 1, an initial entry has been made
!  If JUMPTO = 2, 3, 4 the vector Q = B * P is required

!  The value of the array X_status gives the status of the variables

!  IF X_status( I ) = 0, the I-TH variable is free
!  IF X_status( I ) = 1, the I-th variable is fixed on its lower bound
!  IF X_status( I ) = 2, the I-th variable is fixed on its upper bound
!  IF X_status( I ) = 3, the I-th variable is permanently fixed
!  IF X_status( I ) = 4, the I-th variable is fixed at some other value

!  The addresses of the free variables are given in the first NVAR entries
!  of the array IVAR

!  If the product B * P is required (JUMPTO = 2,3,4), the nonzero components
!  of P occur in positions IVAR(I) for I lying between NVAR1 and NVAR2

!  At the initial point, variables within EPSTOL of their bounds and
!  for which the search direction P points out of the box will be fixed

!  ------------------------- dummy arguments --------------------------

!  N      (INTEGER) the number of independent variables.
!          ** this variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  X0     (REAL array of length at least N) the point x0 from which the Cauchy
!          arc commences. ** this variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  XT     (REAL array of length at least N) the current estimate of the GCP
!  G      (REAL array of length at least N) the coefficients of
!          the linear term in the quadratic function
!          ** this variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  BND    (two dimensional REAL array with leading dimension N and second
!          dimension 2) the lower (BND(*,1)) and upper (BND(*,2)) bounds on
!          the variables. ** this variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  X_status (INTEGER array of length at least N) specifies which
!          of the variables are to be fixed at the start of the minimization.
!          X_status should be set as follows:
!          If X_status( I ) = 0, the I-th variable is free
!          If X_status( I ) = 1, the I-th variable is on its lower bound
!          If X_status( I ) = 2, the I-th variable is on its upper bound
!          If X_status( I ) = 3, 4, the I-th variable is fixed at XT(I)
!  F      (REAL) the value of the quadratic at X0, see above.
!          ** this variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  EPSTOL (REAL) a tolerance on feasibility of X0, see above.

!  BOUNDX (LOGICAL) the search for the generalized cauchy point will be
!          terminated on the boundary of the spherical region ||X-X0|| <= R
!          if and only if BOUNDX is set to .TRUE. on initial (JUMPTO=1) entry.
!          ** this variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  DXSQR  (REAL) the square of the two norm of the distance between the
!          current estimate of the GCP and X0. DXSQR will only be set if
!          BOUNDX is .TRUE.
!  r      (REAL) the radius, R, of the spherical region. r need not be
!          set if boundx is .FALSE. on initial entry.
!          ** This variable is not altered by the subroutine
!  QXT    (REAL) the value of the piecewise quadratic function at the current
!          estimate of the GCP
!  P      (REAL array of length at least N) contains the values of the
!          components of the vector P. On initial (JUMPTO=1) entry, P must
!          contain the initial direction of the 'Cauchy arc'. On a non optimal
!          exit, (JUMPTO=2,3,4), P is the vector for which the product B * P
!          is required before the next re-entry. On a terminal exit (JUMPTO=0),
!          P contains the step XT - X0. The components IVAR(I) = NVAR1, ... ,
!          NVAR2 of P contain the values of the nonzero components of P
!          (see, IVAR, NVAR1, NVAR2)
!  Q      (REAL array of length at least N) on a non initial entry
!         (JUMPTO=2,3,4), Q must contain the vector B * P. Only the
!          components IVAR(I), I=1,...,NFREE, of Q need be set (the other
!          components are not used)
!  IVAR   (INTEGER array of length at least N) on all normal exits
!         (JUMPTO=0,2,3,4), IVAR(I), I = NVAR1, ..., NVAR2, gives the indices
!          of the nonzero components of P
!  NFREE  (INTEGER) the number of free variables at the initial point
!  NVAR1  (INTEGER) see IVAR, above
!  NVAR2  (INTEGER) see IVAR, above
!  NNONNZ (INTEGER) the number of nonzero components of Q on a JUMPTO=3 entry.
!          NNONNZ need not be set on other entries
!  INONNZ (INTEGER array of length at least NNONNZ) on JUMPTO = 3 entries,
!          INONNZ(I), I = 1,....,NNONNZ, must give the indices of the nonzero
!          components of Q. On other entries, INONNZ need not be set
!  IOUT   (INTEGER) the fortran output channel number to be used
!  JUMPTO (INTEGER) controls flow through the subroutine.
!          If JUMPTO = 0, the GCP has been found
!          If JUMPTO = 1, an initial entry has been made
!          If JUMPTO = 2, 3, 4, the vector Q = B * P is required
!  IDEBUG (INTEGER) allows detailed printing. If IDEBUG is larger than 4,
!          detailed output from the routine will be given. Otherwise, no
!          output occurs
!  findmx (REAL) when printing the value of the objective function,
!          the value calculated in fmodel will be multiplied by the
!          scale factor findmx. This allows the user, for instance,
!          to find the maximum of a quadratic function F, by minimizing
!          the function - F, while monitoring the progress as
!          if a maximization were actually taking place, by setting
!          findmx to - 1.0. Normally findmx should be set to 1.0
!  BREAKP (REAL) workspace that must be preserved between calls
!  S      (CAUCHY_save_type) private data that must be preserved between calls

!  JUMPTO must have the value 1. In addition, if the I-th variable is required
!  to be fixed at its initial value, X0(I), X_status(I) must be set to
!  3 or 4. r must be specified if boundx is .TRUE. on initial entry

!  RE-ENTRY:

!  If the variable JUMPTO has the value 2, 3 or 4 on exit, the
!  subroutine must be re-entered with the vector Q containing
!  the product of the second derivative matrix B and the output
!  vector P. All other parameters MUST NOT BE ALTERED

!  Find a suitable approximation to the Generalized Cauchy Point (GCP)
!  for a given quadratic function within a box shaped region

!  If we define the 'Cauchy arc' X(t) = projection of X0 + t*P into the box
!  region BND(*,1) <= X(*) <= BND(*,2), the GCP is the first local minimizer
!  of the quadratic function quad( X ) =

!     0.5 (X-X0) (transpose ) B (X-X0) + G (transpose) (X-X0) + F

!  for points lying on X(t), with t >= 0. A suitable Cauchy point is
!  determined as follows:

!  1) If the minimizer of quad( X ) along X0 + T * p lies on the Cauchy
!     arc, this is the required point. Otherwise,

!  2) Starting from some specified T0, construct a decreasing sequence
!     of values T1, T2, T3, .... . Given 0 < MU < 1, pick the first
!     TI (I = 0, 1, ...) for which the Armijo condition

!        quad( X(TI) ) <= linear( X(TI), MU ) =
!                         F + MU * G (transpose) ( X(TI) - X0 )

!     is satisfied. X0 + TI * P is then the required point

!  Progress through the routine is controlled by the parameter JUMPTO

!  If JUMPTO = 0, the GCP has been found
!  If JUMPTO = 1, an initial entry has been made
!  If JUMPTO = 2, 3, 4 the vector Q = B * P is required

!  The value of the array X_status gives the status of the variables

!  IF X_status( I ) = 0, the I-TH variable is free
!  IF X_status( I ) = 1, the I-th variable is fixed on its lower bound
!  IF X_status( I ) = 2, the I-th variable is fixed on its upper bound
!  IF X_status( I ) = 3, the I-th variable is permanently fixed
!  IF X_status( I ) = 4, the I-th variable is fixed at some other value

!  The addresses of the free variables are given in the first NVAR entries
!  of the array IVAR

!  If the product B * P is required (JUMPTO = 2,3,4), the nonzero components
!  of P occur in positions IVAR(I) for I lying between NVAR1 and NVAR2

!  At the initial point, variables within EPSTOL of their bounds and
!  for which the search direction P points out of the box will be fixed
