                   -----------------
                   EXTERNAL SOFTWARE
                   -----------------

The packages referred to in this directory are not covered by the
same licence as the rest of GALAHAD. Some are available as part
of the HSL archive,

  http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/archive/

others form part of the main HSL

  http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/

amd yet others are avilable elsewhere subject to appropriate
licencing conditions

Although software stubs are provided for these packages to allow
the compilation of GALAHAD, the software itself must be downloaded
separately. The HSL archive codes may be obtained from

  http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/download/hslarchive-galahad/latest

by any user, while the main HSL codes are available for academic
use from

  http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/download/hsl-galahad/latest

(the former is included in the latter, so only a single download is required.)
They should *not* be altered and then redistributed.

We recommend that all users obtain at least the HSL Archive packages.
The other HSL and external packages are not crucial to run GALAHAD,
but providing them will often lead to significantly improved performance.

Separate licencing conditions may apply for commercial incorporation
and redistribution. See

  http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/licencing.htm

for conditions attached to the provided HSL archive packages

   ad02, ma27, ma33 and ma61,

and stricter ones for the useful-but-not-provided HSL main-library
packages

   la04, ma48,  ma57, ma77,  ma86, ma87, ma97, mc61, mc64, mc68,
   mc77, mi20, mi28 and mi35.

The packages MKL, Pardiso and WSMP are availble as binary files from

  https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/onemkl.html
  https://www.pardiso-project.org/

and

  https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=1426

respectively. PaStiX is freely available under the LGPL licence, and can be
downloaded and installed as described in

  https://solverstack.gitlabpages.inria.fr/pastix/md_docs_doxygen_chapters_Pastix_Install.html

MUMPS is again freely available for download and build by filling in the
online registration form available from

  https://graal.ens-lyon.fr/MUMPS/index.php?page=dwnld

Alternatively, it is available as an optional binary download as part of many
Linux distributions, but please make sure that you have Vesion 5.5 (and not
5.2) at the very least.

See $GALAHAD/src/makedefs/packages for more details about downloads
and installation of non-binary packages.
