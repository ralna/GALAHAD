A utility (runlsrb) and script (lsrbmain.f90) to read a matrix in
Rutherford-Boeing format and then to solve an optimization problem
involving its data.

Currently set up to solve

 blls: min 1/2 || A x - b ||^2 + 1/2 sigma ||x||^2 subject to x_l <= x <= xu

or

 slls:  min 1/2 || A x - b ||^2 + 1/2 sigma ||x||^2 subject to e^T x = 0, x >= 0

with random data x_l, x_u and b
