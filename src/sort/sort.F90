!     Sorts the content of real vector x in ascending order, optionally
!     applying the same permutation to the integer vector ix and the
!     real vector rx.  This is an implementation of quicksort (Hoare's
!     partition-exchange sorting).

!     Arguments:

      INTEGER, INTENT( IN ) :: size

!              the size of x

      REAL ( KIND = wp ), DIMENSION ( size ), INTENT( INOUT ) :: x

!              the vector x for sorting (in ascending order)

      INTEGER, INTENT( OUT ) :: exitcode

!              the exitcode can take one of the two following values
!                 OK            ( 0 ) : successful sorting,
!                 WRONG_N       ( 1 ) : size is non-positive
!                 SORT_TOO_LONG ( 2 ) : the sorting request involves
!                                       more than 2** 32 numbers

      INTEGER, DIMENSION ( size ), OPTIONAL, INTENT( INOUT ) :: ix

!              an (optional) integer vector to be sorted according to x

      REAL ( KIND = wp ), &
               DIMENSION ( size ), OPTIONAL, INTENT( INOUT ) :: rx

!              an (optional) real vector to be sorted according to x

!         the starting addresses for the entries in A_row/A_col/A_val in

!
!  liw   integer, which gives the actual dimension of IW
!        liw  must be at least MAX( nr, nc ) + 1.

!  Programming: Nick Gould, 28 November 2011.

!  ------------------------- dummy arguments --------------------------
!
!  nr     integer, which gives the number of rows in A.
!         nr must be non-negative.
!
!  nc     integer, which gives the number of columns in A.
!         nc must be non-negative.
!
!  nnz    integer, which gives the number of nonzeros in A.
!         nnz must be non-negative.
!
!  A_row  integer array of length la. On entry, A_row(k), k = 1, ..., nnz give
!         the row indices of A. On exit, A_row will have been reordered so
!         that entries in column j appear directly before those in column j+1
!         for j = 1, ..., nc-1.
!
!  A_col  integer array of length la. On entry, A_col(k), k = 1, ..., nnz give
!         the column indices of A. On exit, A_col will have been reordered but
!         A_col(k) will still be the column index corresponding to the
!         entry with row index A_row(k).
!
!  la    integer, which gives the actual dimension of A_row/A_col.
!        la must be at least nnz.
!
!  A_ptr  integer array of length lptr. On exit, A_ptr(i), j = 1, ..., nc give
!         the starting addresses for the entries in A_row/A_col in
!         column j, while A_ptr(nc+1) gives the index of the first non-occupied
!         component of A.
!
!  lptr  integer, which gives the actual dimension of A_ptr.
!        lptr must be at least nc + 1.
!
!  IW     workspace integer array of length liw.
!
!  liw   integer, which gives the actual dimension of IW
!        liw  must be at least MAX( nr, nc ) + 1.
!
!  error integer, which gives the output unit number for error messages.
!        Error messages only occur if error > 0.
!
!  warning integer, which gives the output unit number for warning messages.
!        Warning messages only occur if warning > 0.
!
!  inform integer, which gives the exit status of SORT_reorder_by_rows.
!         Possible values are:
!
!          0   A has been successfully re-orderered.
!         -1   A has been successfully re-orderered, but there were duplicate
!              entries which have been summed.
!         -2   A has been successfully re-orderered, but there were row entries
!              out of range which were ignored.
!         -3   A has been successfully re-orderered, but there were column
!              entries out of range which were ignored.
!         -4   A has been successfully re-orderered, but there were no rows
!         -5   A has been successfully re-orderered, but there were no entries
!          1   nr, nc or nnz is too small. The reordering was unsuccessful.
!          2   la < nnz. The reordering was unsuccessful.
!          3   liw < MAX( nr, nc ) + 1. The reordering was unsuccessful.
!          4   lptr < nr + 1. The reordering was unsuccessful.
