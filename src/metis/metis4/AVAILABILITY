A copy of Version 4.0.3 of the software is available from

  https://github.com/CIBC-Internal/metis-4.0.3

We presume that this has been made available "with prior approval"
as signalled in the LICENSE file, but to be sure, you should contact 
the original author or the Regents as mentioned in that file.

If you wish to use the above within GALAHAD, have agreed to
the Metis 4 License conditions, and have downloaded the source tree,
you should copy (or link) all of the *.c files from the Lib directory 
to this directory, i.e., 

  cp Lib/*.c ./ 

Thereafter, the usual GALHAD make, i.e.,

  make -s -f ARCHITECTURE build

where ARCHITECTURE is the name of the desired architecture (that is, the
name of one of the directories in $GALAHAD/makefiles, e.g., pc64.lnx.gfo),
will build a standalone binrary library, libmetis4_nodend.a
